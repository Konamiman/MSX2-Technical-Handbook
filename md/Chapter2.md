# CHAPTER 2 - BASIC

The BASIC of MSX2 has been upgraded: the new version is called MSX BASIC version 2.0. And, when using a disk system, MSX DISK-BASIC can be used, which consists of MSX BASIC version 2.0 and additional instructions for disk operations. The following sections describe these two versions of BASIC.

## 1. LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS

First of all, the sentence and function for each instruction of BASIC are listed. Each instruction is listed in the format shown in [Figure 2.1](#figure-21--instruction-list-format).


##### _Figure 2.1  Instruction list format_

![Figure 2.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Konamiman/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/add-pics/pics/Figure%202.1.png)

#### (a) Syntax of instructions

If there is an **"*"** followed by a keyword, it indicates that the syntax or function of the instruction has just been modified after version 1.0, or that the instruction has been added to version 2.0.

Descriptions of sentences use the following notational conventions.

```
* [item] .............. the item is optional
* [, item ... ] ....... more items having the same form may appear
* [item1 | item2] ..... choose item1 or item2
```

And `<filename>`, which is used in the sentence, is a string specifying I/O devices or files for input/output in the format listed below. `<Filename>` for a cassette files is a string consisting of any combination of up to 6 characters. `<filename>` for disk or RAM disk is a string, whose form is `"<filename (up to 8 characters)> + <filename extension (up to 3 characters)>"`. `<drive>` is one of characters from A to H (depending on the number of drives connected).

```
"CAS: <filename>" ..... Cassette file
"MEM: <filename>" ..... RAM disk
"CRT:" ................ Text screen
"GRP:" ................ Graphic screen
"LPT:" ................ Printer
"<drive>:<filename>" .. Disk file
```

#### (b) Instruction type

There are four types of instructions:

```
* Function ............ Returns a certain value depending on the given parameter(s).
* System variable ..... Variables available from BASIC. Generally, assignment is allowed.
* Statement ........... Takes a certain action.
* Command ............. Gives an instruction to BASIC interpreter itself.
```

#### (c) Function or action of instruction

The following list gives a brief description of the action for each instruction. More detailed descriptions about instructions which have been modified or added at version 2.0 are given in [section 2](#2-differences-in-msx-basic-version-20).

## 2. DIFFERENCES IN MSX BASIC VERSION 2.0

A great deal of functions in MSX BASIC version 2.0 have been added or modified when compared with MSX BASIC version 1.0. They are either the functions that are added or modified with the version-up of VDP (Video Display Processor) or the functions that are added or modified because of the various hardware features such as RAM disk, clock, or memory switch; especially, the alternation of VDP affects, most of the statement for the screen display.

This section picks up these statements and indicates the additions or the modifications. In the following descriptions, "MSX1" means MSX BASIC version 1.0 and "MSX2" for MSX BASIC version 2.0.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.1 Additions or Modifications to Screen Mode

* `SCREEN <screen mode>[, <sprite size>[, <key click switch>[, <cassette baud rate>[, <printer option>[, <interlace mode>]]]]]`

`<Screen mode>` and `<interlace mode>` have been modified.

`<Screen mode>` may be specified from 0 to 8. Modes from 0 to 3 are the same as MSX1 and the rest have been added. When specifying a screen mode, in BASIC it is called "SCREEN MODE", which is somewhat different from "screen mode" which is used by VDP internally. [Table 2.1](#table-21--correspondances-of-basic-screen-screen-modes-and-vdp-screen-modes) shows these correspondences and meanings. The difference between screen modes 2 and 4 is only in the sprite display functions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Specifying `<interlace mode>` enables to set the interlace functions of VDP (see [Table 2.2](#table-22--differences-of-display-function-in-the-interlace-mode)). In the alternate screen display mode, the display page specified in "SET PAGE" must be odd. In this case the display page and the page of which the number is smaller by one is displayed alternately.


##### _Table 2.2  Differences of display function in the interlace mode_

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------
|  Interlace mode  |             Display function               |
|------------------+--------------------------------------------|
|        0         | Normal non-interlaced display (default)    |
|        1         | Interlaced display                         |
|        2         | Non interlaced, Even/Odd alternate display |
|        3         | Interlaced, Even/Odd alternate display     |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

* `SET PAGE <display page>, <active page>`

This statement is new. It allows users to set the page to display and the page to read and write data to. This is valid when the screen mode is between 5 and 8, and the value specified depends on the VRAM capacity and the screen mode (see [Table 2.3](#table-23--page-values-to-be-specified-depending-on-the-screen-mode-and-the-vram-capacity)).


##### Table 2.3  Page values to be specified depending on the screen mode and the VRAM capacity

```
------------------------------------------
| Screen mode |  VRAM 64K  |  VRAM 128K  |
|-------------+------------+-------------|
|  SCREEN 5   |   0 to 1   |   0 to 3    |
|  SCREEN 6   |   0 to 1   |   0 to 3    |
|  SCREEN 7   |  Unusable  |   0 to 1    |
|  SCREEN 8   |  Unusable  |   0 to 1    |
------------------------------------------
```

See the [VRAM map](Appendix5.md) in the APPENDIX for the page assignment on VRAM.

### 2.2 Additions or Modifications for the Colour Specification


* `COLOR [<foreground colour>[, <background colour>[, <border colour>]]]`

In MSX2, with its colour palette feature, the ranges and meanings of values specifying colours in the screen mode are different (see [Table 2.4](#table-24--colour-specifications-for-the-screen-mode)). The `<background colour>` except that of the text display changes when the CLS statement is executed. If the display mode is 0, specification of a `<border colour>` is ignored.

The "border colour" in screen mode 6 has special meanings. [Figure 2.2](#figure-22--bitwise-meanings-for-the-border-colour-on-screen-mode-6) shows the bitwise meanings of `<border colour>` in the mode. In this mode, by changing the flag (bit 4), the colour of vertical lines at odd X-coordinates and the colour of those at even coordinates can be specified differently.

When the flag is 0 (the value of border colour is one of the values from 0 to 15), different colours cannot be specified and the border colour is set as the colour of vertical odd lines. When the flag is 1 (the value of border colour is one of the values from 16 to 31), the border colours are set as the colour of vertical odd lines and that of vertical even lines; when these two colours are different, the screen shows a vertically-striped pattern.


##### _Figure 2.2  Bitwise meanings for the border colour on screen mode 6_

![Figure 2.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Konamiman/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/add-pics/pics/Figure%202.2.png)

* `COLOR = (<palette number>, <red brightness>, <green brightness>, <blue brightness>)`

This statement sets the colour of the specified palette. See [Table 2.4](#table-24--colour-specifications-for-the-screen-mode) for the specification of `<palette number>`. Note that nothing happens and no error occurs wwhen the screen mode is 8, which has no palette feature. Though palette number 0 is ordinally fixed to a transparent colour (that is, border space is seen transparently), it can be dealt in the same way as other palettes by changing the register of VDP:

```
    VDP(9)=VDP(9) OR &H20        (when dealing as with other palettes)
    VDP(9)=VDP(9) AND &HDF       (when fixing it to a transparent colour)
```

##### _Table 2.4  Colour specifications for the screen mode._

```
--------------------------------------------------------
| Screen mode | Colour specification | Range of number |
|-------------+----------------------+-----------------|
|  SCREEN 0   |    Palette number    |     0 to 15     |
|  SCREEN 1   |    Palette number    |     0 to 15     |
|  SCREEN 2   |    Palette number    |     0 to 15     |
|  SCREEN 3   |    Palette number    |     0 to 15     |
|  SCREEN 4   |    Palette number    |     0 to 15     |
|  SCREEN 5   |    Palette number    |     0 to 15     |
|  SCREEN 6   |    Palette number    |     0 to 3      |
|  SCREEN 7   |    Palette number    |     0 to 15     |
|  SCREEN 8   |    Colour number     |     0 to 255    |
--------------------------------------------------------
```

Brightness of each colour can be set to one of eight steps from 0 to 7 and combinig them enables to display 512 colours; 8 (red) x 8 (green) x 8 (blue).


* `COLOR=RESTORE`

This statement resets the colour palette register according to the contents of the colour palette storage table (see APPENDIX [VRAM MAP](Appendix5.md)). For example, if image data written under unusual colour palette settings is BSAVEd, the original images cannot be reproduced because BLOADing the data does not change the colour palettes. Therefore, the image data should be BSAVEd with the colour palette storage table. To obtain the colours of the original images, BLOAD the data and reset the palettes with the COLOR=RESTORE instruction.


* `COLOR [=NEW]`

This statement initialises the colour palette to the same state as when the power of the computer is turned on (see [Table 2.5](#table-25--initial-colours-of-colour-palettes-and-palette-setting-values)). It is a good idea to place this statement at the beginning and the end of the program.


##### _Table 2.5  Initial colours of colour palettes and palette setting values_

```
------------------------------------------------------------------
| Palette |    Colour     | Brightness | Brightness | Brightness |
| number  |               |  of red    |   of blue  |  of green  |
|---------+---------------+------------+------------+------------|
|    0    | transparent   |     0      |     0      |     0      |
|    1    | black         |     0      |     0      |     0      |

|    3    | light green   |     3      |     3      |     7      |
|    4    | deep blue     |     1      |     7      |     1      |

|    8    | bright red    |     7      |     1      |     1      |
|    9    | light red     |     7      |     3      |     3      |
|   10    | bright yellow |     6      |     1      |     6      |
|   11    | pale yellow   |     6      |     3      |     6      |
|   12    | deep green    |     1      |     1      |     4      |

|   15    | white         |     7      |     7      |     7      |
------------------------------------------------------------------
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.3 Additions or Modifications for the Character Display


* `LOCATE [<X-coordinate>[, <Y-coordinate>[, <cursor switch>]]]`

This statement specifies the location to display a character in the text display screen.

Since an 80-character display feature has been added to the screen mode 0, the X-coordinate value can be specified up to 79.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.4 Additions or Modifications for the Graphics Display


* `LINE [{(X1,Y1) | STEP(X1,Y1)}] - {(X2,Y2) | STEP(X2,Y2)}[, <colour> [, {B|BF}[, <logical operation>]]]`
* `PSET {(X,Y) | STEP(X,Y)}[, <colour>[, <logical operation>]]`
* `PRESET {(X,Y) | STEP(X,Y)}[, <colour>[, <logical operation>]]`

The specifiable coordinate range of these statements varies according to the screen mode (see [Table 2.6](#table-26--range-of-coordinates-for-each-screen-mode)).


##### _Table 2.6  Range of coordinates for each screen mode_

```
-------------------------------------------------
| Screen mode |  X-coordinate  |  Y-coordinate  |
|-------------+----------------+----------------|
|  SCREEN 2   |    0 to 255    |    0 to 191    |
|  SCREEN 3   |    0 to 255    |    0 to 191    |
|  SCREEN 4   |    0 to 255    |    0 to 191    |
|  SCREEN 5   |    0 to 255    |    0 to 211    |
|  SCREEN 6   |    0 to 511    |    0 to 211    |
|  SCREEN 7   |    0 to 511    |    0 to 211    |
|  SCREEN 8   |    0 to 255    |    0 to 211    |
-------------------------------------------------
```

The logical operation feature is new. When `<logical operation>` is specified, a logical operation is done between the specified `<colour>` and the original colour, and the colour of its result will be used to draw. Logical operation types are listed in [Table 2.7](#table-27--logical-operation). `<Colour>` is specified by the palette number, except for screen mode 8.


##### _Table 2.7  Logical operation_

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    Logical operation    |               Function to draw                  |
|-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| PSET (default) ,TPSET   | Use "specified colour"                          |
| PRESET         ,TPRESET | Use "NOT (specified colour)"                    |
| XOR            ,TXOR    | Use "(background colour) XOR (specified colour)"|
| OR             ,TOR     | Use "(background colour) OR (specified colour)" |
| AND            ,AND     | Use "(background colour) AND (specified colour)"|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Note:** The list above assumes that `<colour>` is (specified colour) and that the original colour of the place to be drawn is (background colour). Specifying a logical operation preceded by "T" causes nothing to be done when `<colour>` is transparent (colour 0).


* `CIRCLE {(X,Y) | STEP(X,Y)},<radius>[, <colour>[, <start angle>[, <end angle>[, <proportion>]]]]`

The coordinate range to be specified depends on the screen mode (see [Table 2.6](#table-26--range-of-coordinates-for-each-screen-mode)). `<colour>` is specified by the palette number, except for screen mode 8.


* `PAINT {(X,Y) | STEP(X,Y)}[, <colour>[, <border colour>]]`

The coordinate range to be specified depends on the screen mode (see [Table 2.6](#table-26--range-of-coordinates-for-each-screen-mode)). `<Colour>` is specified by the palette number, except for screen mode 8. The specification of `<border color>` is invalid in screen modes 2 and 4.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.5  Additions or modifications for VDP access


* `BASE (<expression>)`

This system variable contains the starting address of each table assigned to VRAM. The contents of `<expression>` and the screen mode tables correspond as listed in [Table 2.8](#table-28--correspondences-between-base-set-values-and-vram-table).

The starting address of the table can be read for each `<expression>`, but can be written only when `<expression>` is a value from 0 to 19 (that is, from screen mode 0 to screen mode 3).

Note that the table of screen mode 4 changes as you change the table address of screen mode 2.

Address returned for screen mode from 5 to 8 is the offset value from the starting address of the active page.


##### _Table 2.8  Correspondences between BASE set values and VRAM table_

```
------------------------------------------------------
| Expression | Screen mode |         Table           |
|------------+-------------+-------------------------|
|     0      |      0      | Pattern name table      |
|     1      |      0      | N/A                     |
|     2      |      0      | Pattern generator table |
|     3      |      0      | N/A                     |

|    44      |      8      | Sprite generator table  |
------------------------------------------------------
```

* `VDP (<n>)`

This allows the value of VDP register to be read and written. `<n>` is slightly different from the actual VDP register number. Their correspondances are listed in [Table 2.9](#table-29--correspondances-with-vdp-register).


##### _Table 2.9  Correspondances with VDP register_

```
---------------------------------------------------
|    n     |  VDP register number   | Access mode |
|----------+------------------------+-------------|
|  0 to 7  | 0 to 7 (same as MSX1)  | Read/write  |
|    8     |   Status register 0    | Read only   |
|  9 to 24 |        8 to 23         | Read/write  |
| 33 to 47 |       32 to 46         | Write only  |
| -1 to -9 | Status register 1 to 9 | Read only   |
---------------------------------------------------
```

* `VPEEK (<address>)`
* `VPOKE <address>, <data>`

When the screen mode is from 5 to 8, the offset value from the starting address of the active page should be set for `<address>`. Valid range for the `<address>` value is from 0 to 65535 and the valid range for the data value is from 0 to 255.


* `BSAVE <filename>, <start address>, <end address>, S`
* `BLOAD <filename> ,S`

These are statements of DISK BASIC, used to save/load the contents of VRAM to/from disk files. Both can be used in any screen mode, note, however, that only the active pages are valid when the screen mode is from 5 to 8. No cassette tapes can be used. Valid value range of `<address>` is from -32768 to -2, or from 0 to 65534 (&HFFFE).


* `COPY (X1,Y1) - (X2,Y2)[, <source page>] TO (X3,Y3)[, <destination page> [, <logical operation>]]`
* `COPY (X1,Y1) - (X2,Y2)[, <source page>] TO {<array variable name> | <filename>}`
* `COPY {<array variable name> | <filename>}[, <direction>] TO (X3,Y3)[, <destination page>[, <logical operation>]]`
* `COPY <filename> TO <array variable name>`
* `COPY <array variable name> TO <filename>`

The COPY statements transfer screen data and are valid when the screen mode is from 5 to 8. VRAM, array variables, and disk files can be used with these statements, and data can be transferred among these at will.

(X1,Y1) - (X2,Y2) means that the rectangular area, with a diagonal formed by these two coordinates is to be transferred. `<Source page>` and `<destination page>` indicate the page to be transferred from and the page to be transferred to, respectively, and if these pages are omitted, the active pages are assumed. `<Direction>` indicates the direction for writing the screen data to the screen, and is specified by a number from 0 to 3 (see [Figure 2.3](#figure-23--directions-for-writing-the-screen-data)).


##### _Figure 2.3  Directions for writing the screen data_

![Figure 2.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Konamiman/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/add-pics/pics/Figure%202.3.png)

`<Array variable>` is of the integer type, or single precision real type, or double precision real type. It should be prepared with enough area to get the screen data. Its size can be calculated by [Expression 1](#expression-1) as shown below. `<Pixel size>` is the number of bits to be used to express one dot on the screen. It is 4 when the screen mode is 5 or 7, 2 for mode 6, and 8 for mode 8. Screen data is stored in the format shown in [Figure 2.4](#figure-24--screen-data-format).

##### _Expression 1_

```
INT ((<pixel size>*(ABS(X2-X1)+1)*(ABS(Y2-Y1)+1)+7)/8)+4 bytes
```

##### _Figure 2.4  Screen data format_

|                                  | n bytes
------------------------------------

(*) If the length of data cannot be divided by byte, excess bits are to be 0.
```

`<Logical operation>` specifies a logical operation between the data which resides on the destination and the data to be transferred. See [Table 2.7]((#table-27--logical-operation)) for the parameters to specify.

When operations preceded by "T" are specified, the transparent portions of the source will not be transferred.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.7 Additions or Modifications for Sprite

The sprites used in screen mode 4-8 of MSX2 are called sprite mode 2, which has upgraded a great deal as compared with MSX1. On MSX1, for example, one sprite could treat only one colour, while in this mode of MSX2 different colours can be specified for each horizontal line and so multi-coloured characters can be realised with one sprite. Additionally, it is a good idea to combine two sprites as though they were one sprite to paint each dot with different colours. And, on MSX1, when more than five sprites are arrayed on a horizontal line, the sprites after the fifth one were not displayed, but on MSX2 up to eight sprites can be displayed, so a higher flexibility is offered.

Colours which can be specified for sprites are shown in [Table 2.4](#table-24--colour-specifications-for-the-screen-mode) (colour statement) except for screen mode 8. The sprite in screen mode 8, not capable of using the palette, uses the colour number for the specification, and only 16 colours can be used (see [Table 2.10](#table-210--sprite-colours-in-screen-mode-8)).


##### _Table 2.10  Sprite colours in screen mode 8_

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 0: Black        | 1: Deep Blue    | 2: Deep Red     | 3: Deep Purple  |
|-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------|
| 4: Deep Green   | 5: Turquoise    | 6: Olive        | 7: Grey         |
|-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------|
| 8: Light Orange | 9: Blue         | 10: Red         | 11: Purple      |
|-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------|
| 12: Green       | 13: Light Blue  | 14: Yellow      | 15: White       |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

* `PUT SPRITE <sprite plane number>[, {(X,Y) | STEP(X,Y)}[, <colour>[, <sprite pattern number>]]]`

In screen modes 1 through 3, Y-coordinate was 209 for erasing the display of the specified sprite and was 208 for erasing the displays of the specified sprite and all sprites following it, but in screen modes 4 through 8, where the limit of Y-coordinate has been increased to 212 dots, the values to be specified are now 217 and 216, respectively.


* `COLOR SPRITE$ (<sprite plane number>) = <string expression>`

This statement specifies a colour for each horizontal line (see [Figure 2.5](#figure-25--relation-of-the-sprite-and-string-expression)).

`<String expression>` consists of one to sixteen characters. Bits 0 throgh 3 of the character's ASCII code are used for the colour specification, and bits 4 throgh 7 are used to specify each function of the sprite (see [Table 2.11](#table-211--bitwise-meanings-of-string-expression)). These specifications are valid only for screen modes 4 through 8.

```
COLOR SPRITE$ = CHR$ (colour of the first line) + CHR$ (colour of the second line) + ...... + CHR$ (colour of the eight line)
```

##### _Figure 2.5  Relation of the sprite and `<string expression>`_

![Figure 2.5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Konamiman/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/add-pics/pics/Figure%202.5.png)

##### _Table 2.11  Bitwise meanings of string expression_

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    b7    | If 1, move the sprite to left by 32 dots.                  |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------|
|          | If 1, move the sprites of the successive planes together.  |
|    b6    | The priority and conflict of sprites are ignored, and when |
|          | sprites are piled up, they are displayed in the colour     |
|          | which is OR-ed with their colour numbers. *                |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------|
|    b5    | If 1, the conflict of sprites are ignored.                 |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------|
|    b4    | Unused.                                                    |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| b0 to b3 | Palette number.                                            |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

* For example, assuming that bit 6 of sprite plane 1 is "0" and bit 6 of sprite plane 2 is "1", only by moving sprite plane 1, will sprite plane 2 be displayed displayed to be piled at the same location.


* `COLOR SPRITE (<sprite plane number>) = <expression>`

This statement sets the whole sprite of the specified plane to the `<expression>`, this uses `<expression>` for colour specification. The format of the colour specification is the same as shown in [Table 2.11](#table-211--bitwise-meanings-of-string-expression), but the specification for b7 is disabled. These are valid for screen modes 4 through 8.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.8 Additions for Optional Features


* `SET VIDEO [<mode>[, <Ym>[, <CB>[, <sync>[, <voice>[, <video input>[, <AV control>]]]]]]]`

This statement is for the superimposer or the digitiser which are optional, so it can be used only for machines which have these features.

`<Mode>` sets the superimposing mode and can be set to the value listed in [Table 2.12](#table-212--input-values-for-set-video-mode).

When `<Ym>` is 1, the brightness of the television is halved.

When `<CB>` is 1, the colour bus of VDP is prepared for input, and, when 0, it is prepared for output.

When `<sync>` is 1, "external sync" is selected, and, when 0, "internal sync" is selected.

`<Voice>` specifies whether to mix external signal for output, and values are listed in [Table 2.13](#table-213--input-values-for-set-video-voice).

`<Video input>` is used to alternate the input of external video signals. When it is 0, the RGB multiconnector is selected; when it is 1, external video signal connector is selected.

`<AV control`> specifies AV control terminal output of the RGB multiconnector. When it is 0, the output is OFF; when it is 1, the output is ON.


##### _Table 2.12  Input values for SET VIDEO `<mode>`._

```
----------------------------------------
| Mode | S1 | S2 | TP | Display screen |
|------+----+----+----+----------------|
|  0   | 0  | 0  | 0  | Computer       |
|  1   | 0  | 1  | 1  | Computer       |
|  2   | 0  | 1  | 0  | Superimpose    |
|  3   | 1  | 0  | 0  | Television     |
----------------------------------------
```

**Note:** In the case of mode 0, external sync cannot be used. In other modes the compoalte output of VDP is not available. S1, S0, and TP are the names of flags in the VDP register.


##### _Table 2.13  Input values for SET VIDEO `<voice>`_

```
----------------------------------------------
| Voice | Function for external voice signal |
|-------+------------------------------------|
|   0   | No mixing                          |
|   1   | Right channel mixed                |
|   2   | Left channel mixed                 |
|   3   | Both channels mixed                |
----------------------------------------------
```

* `COPY SCREEN [<mode>]`

This statement is used for writing data from the colour bus to VRAM, for example, after digitising. This is valid for screen modes 5 to 8.

In mode 0, one field of signals is digitised and written to the display page; in mode 1, two successive fields (that is, one frame) of signals are written to (display page - 1)th page and the display page, so the display page should be an odd page when the mode is 1. The default mode is 0.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.9 Additions for Timer Features


* `GET DATE <string variable name> [,A]`

This statement is for reading the date from the timer and assigning it to the string variable. The format of date to be read is as follows:

```
YY/MM/DD        (YY = lower two digits of year, MM = month, DD = day)
```

e.g.)   85/03/23        (March 23, 1985)

When option A is specified, the alarm date is read.


* `SET DATE <string expression>[, A]`

This statement sets date to timer. The form of parameter and option is the same as "GET DATE"

e.g.) SET DATE "85/03/23"


* `GET TIME <string variable>[, A]`

This statement is for reading time from the timer and assigning it to a string variable. The form of time to be read is as follows:

```
HH:MM:SS        (HH = hour, MM = minute, SS = second)
```

e.g.) 22:15:00          (22 hours 15 minutes 0 seconds)

When A is specified, the time for the alarm is read.


* `SET TIME <string expression>[, A]`

This statement sets the time to the timer. The form of parameter and option is the same as "GET TIME".

e.g.) SET TIME "22:15:00"


* The Alarm

Since the alarm feature is optional, the action taken at the specified time depends on the machine (ordinarily nothing happens).

When the alarm is to be set in both "SET DATE" and "SET TIME", "SET TIME" should be done first (when "SET TIME" is done, date of the alarm set by "SET DATE" will be erased).

The minimum setting for alarm is in minutes (setting in seconds is ignored).


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.10 Additions for Memory Switch

Using "SET" instructions, various settings described below can be stored to the battery-powered RAM in CLOCK-IC. Settings based on these are done automatically at system startup (when the system is powered or reset). "SET TITLE", "SET PROMPT", and "SET PASSWORD" use the same RAM, so only the most recent instruction is valid.


* `SET ADJUST (<X-coordinate offset>, <Y-coordinate offset>)`

This statement sets the location to display on the screen. The coordinate offset is from -7 to 8.


* `SET BEEP <timbre>, <volume>`

This statement sets BEEP sound. `<Timbre>` and `<volume>` are from 1 to 4.

[Table 2.14](#table-214--input-values-for--of-set-beep) shows the correspondance of `<timbre>` and to the actual sound.


##### _Table 2.14  Input values for <timbre> of SET BEEP_

```
------------------------------------------
| Timbre |            Sound              |
|--------+-------------------------------|
|   1    | High tone beep (same as MSX1) |
|   2    | Low tone beep                 |
|   3    | 2 - tone beep                 |
|   4    | 3 - tone beep                 |
------------------------------------------
```

* `SET TITLE <string expression>[, <title colour>]`

This statement specifies the title and the colour of the initial screen at system startup. `<Title>` is set by a string of up to 6 characters and `<colour>` is one of the values on [Table 2.15](#table-215--available-colours-in-set-title). When `<title>` is 6 characters, keyboard input is awaited just after the title screen is displayed.


##### _Table 2.15  Available colours in SET TITLE_

```
-----------------------------------------------------
| Color         |   1    |   2    |   3    |   4    |
|---------------+--------+--------+--------+--------|
| Screen color  | Blue   | Green  | Red    | Orange |
-----------------------------------------------------
```

* `SET PROMPT <prompt>`

This statement sets the prompt. `<Prompt>` can have up to 6 characters.


* `SET PASSWORD <password>`

This statement sets a system password. `<Password>` is a string expression up to 255 characters. Once this statement is done, input of the password is requested for invoking the system. When the correct password is given, the system is normally invoked; otherwise, correct password input is requested. When the system is invoked by pressing both graphic key and stop key, no password input is requested (in this case, the password setting has been done by the key cartridge; however, password input is always required for system startup). The password is disabled by specifying a null character in SET TITLE.


* `SET SCREEN`

This statement records the current parameters of the "SCREEN" statement. At the system startup, they are automatically set. Items to be recorded are the following:

```
Screen number of text mode                      Key click switch
Screen width of text mode                       Printer option
Foreground, background, and border colours      Cassette baud rate
Function key switch                             Display mode
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.11 Additions for RAM Disk

On MSX1 RAM from 0000H to 7FFFH was used only by DOS. On MSX2, however, this portion can be used as a RAM disk of up to 32K bytes. The format of the file name for RAM disk is described below, where `<filename>` is a string which consists of 1 to 8 characters and `<extension>` is one which consists of 1 to 3 characters. Note that ";" (colon), "." (period), control characters of character codes 00H-1FH, and graphic symbols consisting of two bytes cannot be used.

```
    MEM: <filename>[.<extension>]
```

The following are executable operations for the RAM disk:

#### 1. Load/save a BASIC program (always saved in ASCII format)

```    
    SAVE, LOAD, RUN, MERGE
```

When any of the above commands is executed from the program, control returns to the command level.

#### 2. Read/write a sequential file

```
    OPEN, CLOSE
    PRINT #, PRINT USING #
    INPUT #, LINE INPUT #, INPUT$
    EOF, LOC, LOF
```

The RAM disk does not support the following instructions:

1. Random file Read/Write
2. BLOAD, BSAVE
3. COPY


* `CALL MEMINI [(<size>)]`

This statement specifies the amount of memory to be used as a RAM disk, initialises the RAM disk, and deletes all files. When the RAM disk is to be used, this statement should always be executed.

`<Size>` is "the amount of memory to be used as RAM disk minus 1". By default, the maximum size is allocated for RAM disk. "CALL MEMINI(0)" causes the RAM disk feature to be disabled.


* `CALL MFILES`

This statement displays file names on the RAM disk.


* `CALL MKILL ("<filename>")`

This statement deletes the specified file.


* `CALL MNAME ("<old filename>" AS "<new filename>")`

This statement renames the specified file.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.12 Other Additions


* `PAD (<expression>)`

This function returns status to touch pad (touch panel), light pen, mouse, or track ball.

When `<expression>` is 0 to 7, it returns the status to touch pad as on MSX1, and, when `<expression>` is 8 to 11, it returns the status to light pen. Since the coordinates and the value of the switch are read when "PAD(8)" is executed, other data should be read after confirming that the value of PAD(8) is -1 (see [Table 2.16](#table-216--expression-returning-status-to-light-pen)).


##### _Table 2.16  `<Expression>` returning status to light pen_

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
| Expression |                 The value returned                   |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------|
|      8     | -1 when data of light open is valid; otherwise, 0    |
|      9     | X - coordinate of light pen                          |
|     10     | Y - coordinate of light pen                          |
|     11     | -1 when switch of light pen is pressed; otherwise, 0 |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This statement returns the status of the mouse or the track ball connected to port 1 when `<expression>` is 12 to 15 or connected to port 2 when it is 16 to 19 (see [Table 2.17](#table-217--expression-returning-status-to-mouse-or-track-ball)). The mouse and track ball are automatically distinguished from each other.


##### _Table 2.17  `<Expression>` returning status to mouse or track ball_

```
---------------------------------------
| Expression |   The value returned   |
|------------+------------------------|
|   12, 16   | - 1; for input request |

```

Coordinate data is read when PAD(12) or PAD(16) is examined. Coordinate data should be obtained after examining these. The STRIG function is used with the joystick to input the status of the trigger button.

## 3. INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF BASIC

Knowledge of how the BASIC interpreter controls and executes programs is necessary for more advanced use of BASIC. The internal structure of BASIC is discussed next.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 3.1 User's Area

The lowest address of the user's area was different in the MSX1 machine whose amount of RAM was 8K, 16K, 32K, or 64K; in MSX2, it is always 8000H, because MSX2 machines have at least 64K of RAM. It can be obtained from the content of BOTTOM (FC48H).

The highest address of the user's area when no disk drives are connected is F380H; when disk drives are connected (using DISK-BASIC), it depends on the number of disk drives or on the disk capacity. It can be obtained from the content of HIMEM (FC4AH) after reset and before executing CLEAR statement.

[Figure 2.6](#figure-26--state-of-memory-for-basic-mode) shows the state of memory when MSX is invoked.


##### _Figure 2.6  State of memory for BASIC mode_

```
0000 --------------------
     |                  |
     |      BASIC       |
     |   Interpreter    |
     |                  |

     |                  |                            |
     |    User area     |                   --+      |
     |                  |                     |      |
     |------------------|  ⟵ (HIMEM)         |      |32K
     |  Disk work area  |             --+     |16K   |
F380 |------------------|               | 8K  |      |
     | System work area |               |     |      |
FFFF --------------------             --+   --+    --+
```

**Note:** Though the machine has more than 32K bytes of RAM, only 32K bytes are used for BASIC. On MSX2, however, another 32K bytes can be used as a RAM disk by BASIC.

When developping a program on MSX2, we recommend you create it at addresses 8000H to DE3FH as if to install a 2DD-2 drive whose highest address of the user's area is the lowest. The work area of the disk can grow even larger, therefore, HIMEM of the application program should be checked to prevent disasters even in the worst situation. The following are ways to prevent this:

1. Make the work area relocatable
2. Get the work area from BOTTOM
3. Stop after instructing to reduce the number of drives

On MSX, even when disks are mounted, they can be cut off by resetting while pressing the SHIFT key. When only one drive is mounted, the normal invocation causes the work area for two drives to be allocated (mainly for 2 drive simulator): in such a case, invoking the works area for only one drive is possible by resetting while pressing the CTRL key. If these steps are taken, more user's area can be allocated.

### 3.2 Detailed View of the User's Area

[Figure 2.7](#figure-27--state-of-the-users-area) shows how the user's area will be used in BASIC, and [Table 2.18](#table-218--work-areas-with-start-and-end-addresses-of-each-area) shows the work area with information about where these areas start. This work area is read-only (the initialising routine sets it when reset), so actions when it is changed are not guaranteed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Roles of each user's area are described below.


* BASIC program area

A program written in BASIC is stored from the lowest address (8000H on MSX2) of the user's area and its size depends on the amount of the program.


* Variable area

The variable area is located just after the BASIC program area. It is secured to store the name and the value of the variables used when executing the program. The variables storage formats are shown in [Figure 2.8](#figure-28--storage-format-of-simple-variables) (simple variables) and [Figure 2.9](#figure-29--storage-format-of-array-variables) (array variables). Using array variables without declaring in the DIM statement causes the area to be allocated as an array with ten indexes. However, arrays which are more than four dimensional must be declared.


##### _Figure 2.8  Storage format of simple variables_

![Figure 2.8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Konamiman/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/add-pics/pics/Figure%202.8.png)

##### _Figure 2.9  Storage format of array variables_

![Figure 2.9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Konamiman/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/add-pics/pics/Figure%202.9.png)

**Note:** variable data format is the same as the storage format of simple variables. The lower of the 2-byte value is stored first, and the higher byte last.


* Free area

If the program area or the variable area grows too large or a lot of data is stacked and the free area runs out, an "OUT OF MEMORY" error occurs. The amount of free area can be checked by examining PRINT FRE(0) using the FRE function in BASIC.


* Stack area

This is the stack area used by BASIC. It is used in order from high-order address when executing GOSUB or FOR.


* String area

This area is used to reserve the contents of string variables and used from high-order address. The space in this area can be specified by the first parameter of the CLEAR statement in BASIC. The default is 200 bytes. Exhausting the space in this area causes a "OUT OF STRING SPACE" error. The amount of unused area can be checked by examining PRINT FRE("") using the FRE function in BASIC


* File control block

File information is stored in this area with 10BH (267) bytes allocated for each file. The amount of space for files can be specified by the MAXFILES statement of BASIC. At reset, the area for one file (MAXFILES = 1) is allocated. Another space is always allocated for SAVE and LOAD instructions, so actually area for two files is allocated. [Table 2.19](#table-219--file-control-block-fcb-format) shows the format of file control block.


##### _Table 2.19  File control block (FCB) format_

--------------------------------------------------------------
```

* Assembly language area

Use this area to write programs in assembly language or to operate from memory directly. To do these, this area should be reserved by CLEAR statement.


* Work area for disk

Figure 2.10 shows the work area allocated when a disk is mounted. Note that this area does not exist when no disk is mounted. Labels to the right of this figure shows the address information which resides there.

### 3.3 Storage format of BASIC programs

Programs are stored in memory as shown in [Figure 2.11](#figure-211--text-storage-format) and the meaning of its contents are described below.

|  -----------
+->| 00 | 00 |   Code for the end of text (EOT)
   -----------

Note: Link pointers and line numbers are stored with their low bytes first and high bytes last.
```

* Link pointer

The text pointer to the next line is given in the form of an absolute address.


* Line number

This stores the line number of the program, normally the values from 0 to 65529 (from 0000H to FFF9H). It is possible to make line numbers of 65530 or more, but LIST command does not list them.


* Text

The program body is stored here in the intermediate code format. Reserved words (keywords), operators, numeric values are converted to the intermediate codes, and others (such as variable names or string constantes) are stored as character codes. [Table 2.20](#table-220--list-of-intermediate-codes) lists the intermediate codes and [Figure 2.12](#figure-212--numeral-formats-in-text) shows the numeric formats in text.

See the appendix at the end of this book for character codes. Graphic characters are stored in 2 bytes (2 characters) of `"CHR$(1) + (graphic character code + 64)"`, so be careful when defining graphic characters.

Numbers called "identification codes" are assigned numeric values to distinguish them from reserved words and variable names, and by referring to them the following values can be recognised.

The high and low bytes of a 2-byte numeric value are stored in reverse. Signed numeric values have only the intermediate codes + or - preceding the identifying codes, numeral values themselves are always stored as positive values. Floating-point notations are almost the same as the descriptions of [Math-Pack](Appendix2.md) (Mathematical Package) in the APPENDIX, note that numerical values are always stored as positive. Binary numbers (&B) do not have identifying codes and are stored as ASCII codes.

## 4.  LINKING WITH ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMS

As described so far, MSX BASIC version 2.0 has powerful features, but, if you wish to save execution time even more or to make full use of MSX2 hardware, you should use assembly language. The following sections show how to call assembly language programs from BASIC and gives the information you will need.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 4.1 USR Function

To call the assembly language routine from BASIC, follow the steps described below. The value in parenthesis of the USR function is passed to the assembly language routine as an argument. The argument may be either an expression or a string expression.

1. Specify the starting address of the assembly language program for the execution, using DEF USR statement.
2. Call the assembly language program by USR function.
3. Execute RET (C9H) when returning from the assembly language routine to BASIC.

e.g.) To call the assembly language program whose starting address is C000H:

```
    DEFUSR=&HC000
    A=USR(0)
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 4.2 Data Exchange by the Argument and Return Value of USR Function

When the argument is passed from BASIC to the assembly language program, its type can be checked by examining the contents of register A in the assembly language program (see [Table 2.21](#table-221---argument-types-assigned-to-register-a)). Since the object value is stored in the form as shown in [Figure 2.13](#figure-213--how-values-are-passed-as-arguments) according to the argument type, you can get the value according to the format. As an example, [List 2.1](#list-21--example-of-the-argument-of-string-type) shows a program which receives an argument of the string type.

##### _Table 2.21   Argument types assigned to register A_

```
--------------------------------------
|  2  |  2-byte integer type         |
|  3  |  String type                 |

|  8  |  Double precision real type  |
--------------------------------------
```

##### _List 2.1  Example of the argument of string type_

        PUSH    DE
        POP     IX              ;IX := string descriptor
        LD      A,(IX+0)        ;get string length
        LD      L,(IX+1)        ;get string pointer (low)
        LD      H,(IX+2)        ;get string pointer (high)

        INC     HL
        JR      RD1

        END
```

On the other hand, these values passed as arguments can be passed to BASIC as USR function values by changing them in the assembly language program. In this case the type of return value can alse be changed to types other that of the argument from BASIC by changing VALTYP (F663H). Note that the amount of characters for a string cannot be changed.

### 4.3 Making New Commands

In MSX the reserved words "CMD" and "IPL" are currently unused and by changing the pointers to these words (FE0DH and FE03H) to jump to your own assembly language routine, new commands can be built. [List 2.2](#list-22--making-cmd-command) shows a simple example.


##### _List 2.2  Making CMD command_

```
;*****************************************************************
;  List 2.2   make CMD command ( turn on/off the CAPS LOCK )
; to initialize command:                DEF USR=&HB000 : A=USR(0)
; to use command:                       CMD
;*****************************************************************
;
CHGCAP  EQU     0132H           ;CAPS LAMP on/off
CAPST   EQU     0FCABH          ;CAPS LOCK status
HCMD    EQU     0FE9DH          ;CMD HOOK

        ORG     0B000H

;----- CMD initialize -----   Note:  Executing this section adds the CMD command

        LD      BC,5            ;NEW HOOK SET
        LD      DE,HCMD
        LD      HL,HDAT
        LDIR
        RET

;----- new HOOK data -----    Note:  5-byte data to be written into hook (FE0DH)

HDAT:   POP     AF
        JP      CAPKEY
        NOP

;----- executed by CMD -----  Note:  Actual CMD command

CAPKEY: CALL    CHGCAP
        LD      A,(CAPST)
        CPL
        LD      (CAPST),A
        RET

        END
```

The first "POP AF" written to the pointer in this case, discards the error handling addresses stacked at "CMD" execution. Without this, the "RET" command would jump to the error handling routine isntead of returning to BASIC. It is a way to use this address for printing errors inside of user routine.

These pointers are reserved for future expansion, so should not be used with application programs on the market.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 4.4 Expansion of CMD command

For more sophisticated expansions of statements it is useful if arguments can be passed to the CMD command. As the HL register points to the next location after "CMD" in the BASIC text when the assembly language routine is called, it can be done by appreciating the successive string. The following is a list of internal routines, useful for these.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### CHRGTR (4666H/MAIN)

Extract one character from text (see [Figure 2.14](#figure-214--inputoutput-state-of-chrgtr))

* **Input**: HL ⟵ Address pointing to text
* **Output**:
  * HL ⟵ Address of the extracted character
  * A  ⟵ Extracted character
  * Z  flag ⟵ ON at the end of line (: or 00H)
  * CY flag ⟵ ON if 0 to 9

Purpose: Extract one character from the text at (HL + 1). Spaces are skipped.

#### FRMQNT (542F/MAIN)

Evaluate an expression in 2-byte integer type.

* **Input**: HL ⟵ Starting address of the expression in text
* **Output**:
  * HL ⟵ Address after the expression
  * DE ⟵ Result of evaluation of the expression

Purpose: Evaluate an expression and make output in integer type (INT). When the result is beyond the range of 2-byte integer type, an "Overflow" error occurs and the system returns to the BASIC command level.

<p>&nbsp;<p/>


#### GETBYT (521C/MAIN)

Evaluate an expression in 1-byte integer type.

* **Input**: HL ⟵ Starting address of the expression in text
* **Output**:
  * HL ⟵ Next address of expression
  * A, E ⟵ Result of expression evaluation (A and E contains the same value.)

Purpose: Evaluate an expression and make 1-byte integer output. When the result is beyond the range of 1-byte integer type, an "Illegal function call" error occurs and the execution returns to BASIC command level.

<p>&nbsp;<p/>


#### FRESTR (67D0/MAIN)

Register a string.

* **Input**:
  * [VALTYP (F663H)] ⟵ Type (if not string type, an error occurs)
  * [DAC (F7F6H)]    ⟵ Pointer to string descriptor
* **Output**: HL ⟵ Pointer to string descriptor

Purpose: Register the result of the string type obtained by FRMEVL and obtain its string descriptor. When evaluating a string, this is generally combined with FRMEVL described above to use as follows:

```
 .
 .
 .
CALL    FRMEVL
PUSH    HL
CALL    FRESTR
EX      DE,HL
POP     HL
LD      A,(DE)
 .
 .
 .
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### PTRGET (5EA4/MAIN)

Obtain the address for the storage of a variable (see [Figure 2.16](#figure-216--inputoutput-state-of-ptrget)).

* **Input**:
  * HL ⟵ Starting address of the variable name in text
  * [SUBFLG (F6A5H)] ⟵ 0: Simple variable, other than 0: array variable
* **Output**:
  * HL ⟵ Address after the variable name
  * DE ⟵ Address where the contents of the objective variable is stored

Purpose: Obtain the address for the storage of a variable (or an array variable). Allocation of the area is also done when the area for the objective variable has not been allocated. When the value of SUBFLG is set to other than 0, the starting address of the array is obtained, other than individual elements of the array.

Since these internal routines are for BASIC texts, the same error handling as BASIC is done when an error occurs. In this case, by changing H.ERROR (FFB1H), the user can handle the error (the E register contains the error number) (see [List 2.3](#list-23--changing-error-handling-routine)).

### 4.5 Interrupt usage

The Z80 CPU has INT and NMI interrupt terminals. The MSX, however, uses only INT. The INT terminal gets 60 Hz signals, so timer interrupts are executed 60 times per 1 second. As the interrupt mode of Z80 is set to 1, 38H is called when an interrupt occurs and then the system control jumps to the timer interrupt routine, where various operations such as key input are done.

The timer interrupt routine jumps to hook H.TIMI (FD9FH) in mid course. Using this hook enables the user to add a function to this timer interrupt routine. Thogh there is ordinarily only a RET command, be careful when peripherals such as disks are connected and this hook is already in use. In this case, careless modifications causes peripherals to be disabled, so prearrangement is necessary to make machines to execute that normally. List 2.4 is an example of this handling and the interrupt usage.

## 5. NOTES ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

There are some matters, when developing the software for MSX, that should be followed so as to make the software work without any problems on any MSX machines. The following describes these matters and introduces information that will help you develop software.


### BIOS

The purpose of BIOS is to separate the hardware and the software and to make the software still valid if the hardware changes. Applications for sale which manage input and output should use BIOS (except for VDP).

BIOS is called through the jump table which begins at 0000H of MAIN-ROM. Though MSX2 has a jump table on SUB-ROM, it is used for calling the extended functions. The branch destination of the jump table or, the contents of BIOS may be modified for the hardware modification or the extension of the function, so applications should not call them directly. Thogh this book has some examples that call addresses other than the BIOS jump table, you should consider them for information only (see [BIOS list](Appendix1.md) in APPENDIX). Applications can call Math-Pack and internal routines for the extended statements described above. These will not be changed in the future.


### Work area

F380H to FFFFH of MAIN-RAM cannot be used, as it is a work area for BIOS and BASIC interpreter. Free space in the work area cannot be used, because it is reserved for the future use. See [3.1 User's area](#31-users-area) for the work area of the disk.


### Initialisation of RAM and stack pointer

The contents of RAM are unpredictable when the machine is powered and areas other than system work are are not initialised. Applications should initialise the work area. There was once an application which expected the contents of RAM to be 00H and was unusable.

The value of the stack pointer when the INIT routine (see [Section 7 of Chapter 5](Chapter5b.md)) in the ROM cartridge is called is unpredictable and the value when disk interface has been initialised is smaller than when not. For these reasons some programs which did not initialise the stack pointer had unpredictable results. Programs which are invoked by the INIT routine and continue processing (that is, programs which do not need to use peripherals such as disks or BASIC interpreter) should initialise the stack pointer.


### Work area of extended BIOS

When using extended BIOS calls, a stack should be placed above C000H so that CPU can refer to the work area even if the slot is switched over. For the same reason, FCB of RS-232C should be above 8000H.


### Work area of device drivers, etc.

Special attention should be paid for the allocation of the work area of programs which reside in memory with another program at the same time, programs such as the device driver or a subroutine called from BASIC.

The INIT routine of the cartridge changes BOTTOM (FC48H), reserves the area between the old BOTTOM and new BOTTOM as its work area, and records the address of the work area to 2-byte area SLTWRK (FD09H) allocated for each slot. For more details, see [Section 7 of Chapter 5](Chapter5b.md).


### Hook

When using the RS-232C cartridge, change the hook for an interrupt. For example, if another cartridge uses an interrupt hook, the RS-232C cartridge cannot use the same hook. To prevent this, the previous contents of the hook (inter-slot call command for the interrupt handling routine of RS-232C cartridge, in the example above) should be copied to another location, and, when called by the hook, it should be called so that all cartridges intending to use the hook can receive control (see [Figure 2.18](#figure-218--initialisation-of-the-hook)). For more details, see [Section 7 of Chapter 5](Chapter5b.md).


#### _Figure 2.18  Initialisation of the hook_

```

|   Hook    | <---+    | Program 2 | ---+     | Program 1 |

```

### VRAM capacity

The capacity of VRAM can be found by evaluating bits 1 and 2 of MODE (FAFCH) (see [Table 2.22](#table-222--getting-the-information-about-the-vram-capacity)).


#### _Table 2.22  Getting the information about the VRAM capacity_

```
----------------------------------
|    [FAFCH]    |                |
|---------------|  VRAM Capacity |
| Bit 2 | Bit 1 |                |
|-------+-------+----------------|
|   0   |   0   |   16K (MSX1)   |
|   0   |   1   |   64K (MSX2)   |
|   1   |   0   |  128K (MSX2)   |
----------------------------------
```

### BASIC version number

The following methods can be used for applications to find out the version number of BASIC.

1. Read the contents of 2DH of MAIN-ROM (00H = version 1.0, 01H = version 2.0, and so on).
2. In version 2.0 or later versions, EXBRSA (FAF8H) contains the slot address of SUB-ROM. When it has none (00H), the version is version 1.0.


### International MSX

There are different kinds of MSX for various countries. The following items are different by country:

- Keyboard arrangement, character set, PRINT USING format
- Timer interrupt frequency

The version of machine can be found by reading the ID byte information in ROM (see [Figure 2.19](#figure-219--contents-of-id-byte)) and the correspondence for MSX of each country will be accomplished (see [Table 2.23](#table-223--msx-format-for-each-country)).

### Escape sequence

MSX has the escape sequence feature (see [Appendix 10](Appendices8and10.md#appendix-10---escape-sequences)), which can be used in the PRINT statement of BASIC, and in console output of BIOS or BDOS call (MSX-DOS). The escape sequence feature is a subset of DEC VT52 terminal and Heathkit H19 terminal.


### Returning to BASIC

_Warm start_

After selecting a slot of MAIN-ROM, jump to 409BH of MAIN-ROM. If the work area of BASIC has not been destroyed, the BASIC prompt will be displayed. The contents of register and stack at the jump are ignored.

Another way is to execute the next command in internal routine NEWSTT (see [4.4 of Chapter 2](Chapter2.md#44-expansion-of-cmd-command)) (see [Figure 2.20](#figure-220--input-setting-of-newstt-for-the-warm-start))


#### _Figure 2.20  Input setting of NEWSTT for the warm start_

```
  3AH   81H   00H
----------------------
|  :  | END |     |       = (:END)
----------------------
   ^         word
   |         stop
   HL
```

### Auto start

In the case of simple game cartridges which do not use the BIOS or BASIC work areas, the program can be invoked by writing a starting address for the program to "INIT" in ROM header. But using this method prevents the initial settings of another cartridge, so disk drives cannot be used.

To prevent this, the hook "H.STKE" is at FEDAH; write the inter-slot call command in the program to be invoked at the execution on "INIT" routine of the cartridge, and return to the system by RET command. Then after initialising all cartridges and after preparing the DISK BASIC environment if there is a disk, the hook is called, so the objective program can be invoked. This method is also effective when there is no disk (see APPENDIX).
