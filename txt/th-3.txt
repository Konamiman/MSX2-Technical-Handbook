Changes from the original:

- Remarks (1) and (2) about the FCB format in version 2 of MSX-DOS have been 
added.

- Description of function call 06H is modified. The name of this function in 
the original text is "String output", and the setup description is "E 
register <-- starting address of string to send to the console. When 0FF is 
specified, the character will be sent to the console as character code."

- In description of function calls 13H (Deleting files) and 23H (File size 
acquisition), the original text has "DE register <-- starting address of 
opened FCB" in setup field. Instead of this, the correct setup explanation is 
set.

- In description of function 26H (Random writing to the disk 2), the correct 
term "FCB" is set instead of "DMA" in DE register setup explanation.

- In description of function 27H (Random readout 2), the phrase "When this 
number is almost one, the data which has been read is set in the area 
indicated by DMA" has been added.

- In 1.2 MSX-DOS Environment, "see Chapter 3" has been corrected to 
"see Section 3".

CHAPTER 3 - MSX-DOS

Large capacity storage devices with high-speed access are necessary for 
business applications. That is why a disk operating system was added to the 
MSX machine. The DOS (disk operating system) is also required to handle the 
large amount of data on the disk effectively. MSX-DOS is derived from MS-DOS 
which is used widely on 16-bit machines. Thus, it represents the most 
powerful DOS environment for Z-80 based machines. Chapter 3 describes the 
basic operations of MSX-DOS and the use of the system calls.


1.  OVERVIEW

What kind of software is MSX-DOS? What does it offer to users? The following 
sections describe and introduce the features, functions, and software 
configurations of MSX-DOS.


1.1 Features of MSX-DOS


* Consolidation of disk operating environment

MSX-DOS is the disk operating system for MSX computers. It works with any 
version of MSX and can be operated on both the MSX1 and MSX2 without any 
problem. Disk operation on MSX is always done via MSX-DOS. This is also true 
concerning MSX DISK-BASIC, which uses BDOS calls for disk input/output. 
MSX-DOS and DISK-BASIC use the same disk format so that file conversion 
between BASIC and DOS is not necessary. This greatly increases operating 
efficiency and allows more effective use of file resources when MSX-DOS is 
used as the software development environment.


* Compatibility with MS-DOS

MSX-DOS, created on the basis of MSX-DOS (ver 1.25) which is a disk operating 
system for 16-bit personal computers, uses the same file format as MS-DOS. It 
is compatible with MS-DOS at the file level so that MSX-DOS can read and 
write files written on MS-DOS disks. In turn MS-DOS can read and write files 
created by MSX-DOS. Both disk operating systems use similar commands, so 
users who are familiar with MSX-DOS can easily use MS-DOS when upgrading to 
16-bit machines.


* Using CP/M applications

MSX-DOS has system call compatibility with CP/M and can execute most programs 
created on CP/M without any modification. Most CP/M applications can thus be 
easily used with MSX-DOS. This opens up a large library of existing software 
which can be run on the MSX machines.


1.2 MSX-DOS Environment


* System requirements

To use MSX-DOS, a minimum configuration of 64K bytes RAM, a CRT, one disk 
drive, and a disk interface ROM is required. If less than 64K bytes RAM is 
installed, MSX-DOS cannot be used. MSX computers can only use MSX-DOS if they 
have 64K bytes RAM or more. Since MSX2 computers always have 64K bytes or 
more of RAM, they can always run MSX-DOS. A limited disk basic is used on 
those machines with less than 64K bytes RAM. Disk interface ROM is always 
supplied with the disk drive, and, on MSX machines with an internal disk 
drive, it resides inside the machine. For those machines using disk 
cartridges, it is in the cartridge.


* System supported

MSX-DOS supports up to eight disk drives. On a one-drive system, it has a 
2-drive simulation feature (it uses one drive as two drives by replacing 
diskettes temporarily). It supports keyboard input, screen output, and 
printer output.


* Media supported

MSX-DOS, which has a flexible file manager that does not depend on the 
physical structure of the disk, supports various media and uses 3.5 inch 
double density disks as standard. Either a one-sided disk called 1DD or 
two-sided disk called 2DD is used. Each of them uses either an 8-sector track 
format so four kinds of media can be used. The Microsoft formats for these 
four types are shown below.

1.3 MSX-DOS System Resources


* Memory map

MSX-DOS consists of the following modules: COMMAND.COM, MSXDOS.SYS, and a 
disk interface ROM. It resides in memory as shown in Figure 3.1 when MSX-DOS 
is active. COMMAND.COM and MSXDOS.SYS are disk files until MSX-DOS is booted 
and then read into RAM after that. Disk interface ROM includes a disk driver, 
DOS kernel, and DISK-BASIC interpreter.

        |     MSXDOS.SYS      |
        |---------------------|
        |      work area      |
FFFFH   -----------------------


The area 00H to FFH of RAM is called the system scratch area, which is used 
by MSX-DOS for exchanging data with other programs. This area is important 
when using system calls, which are described later. The area which begins at 
0100H and ends where the contents of 0006H of RAM indicates is calles the TPA 
(Transient Program Area). This area is accessible by the user. MSXDOS.SYS 
always resides at a higher address than TPA (when destroyed, the result is 
unpredictable), and COMMAND.COM is placed in TPA.


* COMMAND.COM

The main operation of MSX-DOS is to accept typing commands from the keyboard 
and execute them. In this case the program COMMAND.COM is responsible for the 
process from getting a string to interpreting and executing it, or accepting 
commands from the user interface. Programs executed by COMMAND.COM consists 
of internal commands, batch commands, and external commands.

Internal commands are inside COMMAND.COM and on RAM. Typing an internal 
acommand causes COMMAND.COM to call and execute it immediately.

For the external command, COMMAND.COM loads the routine from disk to TPA and 
executes it (the execution of external commands always begins at 100H). In 
this case COMMAND.COM frees its own area for the external command. That is, 
COMMAND.COM might erase itself and writes the external command onto it, when 
the external command is small enough and does not use the high-end of TPA, 
COMMAND.COM would not be destroyed. When the external command ends with 
"RET", MSXDOS.SYS examines whether COMMAND.COM has been destroyed (by using 
checksum) and, if so, re-loads COMMAND.COM onto RAM and passes the control to 
COMMAND.COM.

Batch commands are carried out by getting command line input from a batch 
file instead of from the keyboard. Each step of the batch file can execute 
any internal command or external command. It is possible that the batch 
command executes another batch command, but the control will not return to 
the caller after the called batch command is done.


* MSXDOS.SYS

MSXDOS.SYS, core of MSX-DOS, controls disk access and communications with 
peripherals. These MSXDOS.SYS functions are opened as "BDOS (Basic Disk 
Operating System)" so that the user can use them. Each routine opened is 
called a "system call", which is useful in developping software for managing 
the disk (see chapter 4). Each execution is, however, not done by MSXDOS.SYS 
itself but DOS kernel. MSXDOS.SYS is an intermediation which arranges 
input/output requests from COMMAND.COM or external commands and passes them 
to the DOS kernel.

MSXDOS.SYS includes a portion called BIOS other than BDOS, as shown in Figure 
3.2. BIOS, which has been prepared to be compatible with CP/M, is not 
normally used.

* DOS kernel

The DOS kernel is the fundamental input/output routine which resides in the 
disk interface ROM and executes BDOS functions of MSXDOS.SYS. Actually, any 
system call function can be executed using the DOS kernel. DISK-BASIC 
executes system calls by calling the DOS kernel directly.


* Procedure for invoking MSX-DOS

MSX-DOS is invoked by the following procedure:

1. Resetting MSX causes all the slots to be examined first, and when two 
bytes, 41H and 42H, are written in the top of the examined slot, the slot is 
interpreted as connected to a certain ROM. When connected with ROM, the INIT 
(initialize) routine whose address is set to the header portion of ROM is 
carried out. In the case of the INIT routine of the disk interface ROM, the 
work area for the drive connected to the interface is allocated first.

2. When all slots have been examined, FEDAH (H.STKE) is then referred to. 
Unless the contents of this address is C9H (unless a certain routine is set 
to the hook of H.STKE during INIT routine), the environment for DISK-BASIC is 
prepared and execution jumps to H.STKE.

3. When the contents of H.STKE is C9H in the examination above, the cartridge 
with TEXT entry is searched in each slot and, if found, the environment for 
DISK-BASIC is prepared, and then the BASIC program at the cartridge is 
carried out.

4. Then, the contents of the boot sector (logical sector #0) is transferred 
to C000H to C0FFH. At this time, when "DRIVE NOT READY" or "READ ERROR" 
occurs, or when the top of the transferred sector is neither EBH nor E9H, 
DISK-BASIC is invoked.

5. The routine at C01EH is called with CY flag reset. Normally, since code 
"RET NC" is written to this address, nothing is carried and the execution 
returns. Any boot program written here in assembly language is invoked 
automatically.

6. RAM capacity is examined (contents of RAM will not be destroyed). Less 
than 64K bytes causes DISK-BASIC to be invoked.

7. The environment for MSX-DOS is prepared and C01EH is called with a CY flag 
set. MSXDOS.SYS is loaded from 100H, and the execution jumps to 100H. After 
this, MSX-DOS transfers itself to a high order address. If MSXDOS.SYS does 
not exist, DISK-BASIC is invoked.

8. MSXDOS.SYS loads COMMAND.COM from 100H and jumps to its start address. 
COMMAND.COM  also transfers  itself to a high order address and then begins 
to execute. If COMMAND.COM does not exist, the message "INSERT A DISKETTE" 
appears and the execution waits for the correct diskette to be inserted in 
the drive.

9. At the first boot for MSX-DOS, when a file named "AUTOEXEC.BAT" exists, it 
is carried out as a batch file. When MSX-DOS is not invoked and DISK-BASIC 
starts, if a BASIC program named "AUTOEXEC.BAS" exists, it will be carried 
out.


2.  OPERATION

This section describes how to type command line input from the keyboard. This 
is the basis of MSX-DOS operations. Several examples of actual use and their 
explanations will be given for the commands used in MSX-DOS.


2.1 Basic Operations


* Message at startup

When MSX-DOS is invoked, the following message appears on the screen:


   Figure 3.3  Screen at atartup

-----------------------------------
|                                 |
|   MSX-DOS version 1.03          |
|   Copyright 1984 by Microsoft   |
|                                 |
|   COMMAND version 1.11          |
|                                 |
-----------------------------------

The upper two lines show the version of MSXDOS.SYS and its copyright. The 
last line shows the version of COMMAND.COM.


* Prompt

Then, a prompt (input request symbol) appears under the version description. 
The prompt for MSX-DOS consists of two characters: the default drive name 
plus ">".


* Default drive

The term "default drive" as the first character of the prompt is the drive to 
be accessed automatically when the drive name is omitted. When the default 
drive is A, for example, referring to a file "BEE" on drive "B" needs to be 
typed as "B:BEE". A file "ACE" on drive A, however, can be typed simply as 
"ACE" omitting the drive name.

     ex.1)     A>DIR B:BEE       (<-- referring to "BEE" on drive B)
     ex.2)     A>DIR ACE         (<-- referring to "ACE" on drive A)


* Changing default drive

When using systems with more than one drive, typing "B" causes the default 
drive to be changed to B. When changing the default drive to C to H, "C" or 
the appropiate letter is needed. Specfification of a drive which does not 
exist causes an error.

     ex.1)     A>B:
               B>       (<-- Default drive has been changed to B)

     ex.2)     A>K:
               Invalid Drive Specification
               A>       (<-- Drive K does not exist.
                             Default drive is not changed.)


* Command input

When a prompt is displayed it indicates that MSX-DOS requests a command  to 
be input. By typing in a command, MSX-DOS can get an instruction.

Three forms of commands exist as shown in Table 3.2. The COMMAND.COM program 
interprets and executes these commands. MSX-DOS operations are repeats of the 
actions "give a command - make COMMAND.COM execute it".


   Table 3.2  Three forms of commands

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| (1) Internal |  Command inside COMMAND.COM. Assembly routine on RAM.  |
|     command  |  Thirten commands are prepared as described later.     |
|--------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| (2) External |  Assembly routine on disk. It is loaded from disk at   |
|     command  |  execution. Its file name has an extension "COM".      |
|--------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| (3) Batch    |  Text file containing one or more commands. Commands   |
|     command  |  are executed orderly (batch operation). File names    |
|              |  have the extension "BAT".                             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


* File name convention

Files handled by MSX-DOS are expressed by a "file spec" which is described 
below:

(1) File spec is expressed in the form "<drive>:<file name>".

(2) <drive> is a character from A to H. When specifying the default drive, it 
can be omitted as well as the colon ":" following it.

(3) <file name> is expressed in the form of "<filename>.<extension>".

(4) <filename> is a string containing one or more (up to 8) characters. When 
more than 8 characters are sepcified, the ninth and subsequent characters are 
ignored.

(5) <extension> is a string containing up to 3 (including zero) characters. 
When more than 3 characters are specified, 4th and subsequent chartacters are 
ignored.

(6) <extension> can be omitted as well a preceding period ".".

(7) Characters which are available in <filename> and <extension> are shown in 
Table 3.3.

(8) Cases are not sensitive. Capital letters and small letters have the same 
meaning.


   Table 3.3  Available characters for file name

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Available   | A to Z   0 to 9   $  &  #  % (  )  -  @  ^  {  }  '  `  ! |
| characters  |  characters corresponding to character codes  80H to FEH  |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Unavailable |  ~  *  +  ,  .  /  :  ;  =  ?  [  ]                       |
| characters  |  characters corresponding to character codes  00H to 20H  |
|             |  and 7FH, FFH                                             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Wildcards

Using a special character called a "wildcard" in the description of 
<filename> and <extension> of the file specification causes files with common 
characters to be specified. Wildcards are "?" and "*".

(1)  "?" is a substitution for one character.
         ex)   "TEXT", "TEST", "TENT"           <-- "TE?T"
               "F1-2.COM", "F2-6.COM"           <-- "F?-?.COM"

(2)  "*" is a substitution for a string with any length.
         ex)   "A", "AB", "ABC"                 <-- "A*"
               "files with an extension .COM"   <-- "*.COM"
               "all files"                      <-- "*.*"

When comparing existing file names and file names with wildcards, the portion 
less than 8 characters of <filename> and the portion less than 3 characters 
of <extension> are considered to be padded with spaces (" "). Thus, a 
specification "A???.??" is not expanded to "ABCDE.123" but to "AZ.9", as 
shown in Figure 3.4.


   Figure 3.4  Wildcard expansion

              ---------------------------------   -------------

              ---------------------------------   -------------
                ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^       ^   ^   ^
                |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       |   |   |
                O   O   O   O   X   O   O   O       O   O   X
                |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       |   |   |
                V   V   V   V   V   V   V   V       V   V   V
              ---------------------------------   -------------
  A???.?? --> | A | ? | ? | ? |   |   |   |   |   | ? | ? |   |
              ---------------------------------   -------------
                ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^       ^   ^   ^
                |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       |   |   |
                O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O       O   O   O
                |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       |   |   |
                V   V   V   V   V   V   V   V       V   V   V
              ---------------------------------   -------------
     AZ.9 --> | A | Z |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 9 |   |   |
              ---------------------------------   -------------


An asterisk (*) is interpreted as either 8 question marks or 3 question marks 
(?) depending on if it is in the file name position or file extension 
position. For example, a file name "A*B" is not interpreted as "any strings 
which begin with A and end with B". It is interpreted as "any strings which 
begin with A", as shown below.

        A*B             ("*" is expanded to 8 "?"s)
         |
         V
        A????????B      (Characters after 8th are deleted)
         |
         V
        A???????


* Device name

MSX-DOS does not need special commands for data input/output with 
peripherals. This means that it considers each objective device as a certain 
file (device file) and input/output actions are done by reading or writing to 
or from this file. This enables MSX-DOS users to treat input/output devices 
in the same way as files on a disk. Five devices are supported as standard by 
MSX-DOS as shown in Table 3.4 and are specified with proper names. For this 
reason, these names can not be used to specify disk files. These device names 
with drive specifications or extensions are also treated as simple device 
names.


   Table 3.4  Device names

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Device name |          Input/output device to be specified             |

* Input functions using a template

A "template" is a character buffer area and can be used for command input. 
The template contains the previous command line most recently entered. It is 
possible to use the template for easier command entry. By taking advantage of 
this template feature, it is easy to execute previous commands again or to 
execute the command partially modified. The keys listed in Table 3.6 are used 
for the template operation.


* Other special keys

In addition to the template operation keys, the following control keys are 
also available. These special key functions also support some other system 
calls described later.

* Disk errors

When an error occurs during disk access, MSX-DOS retries sometimes. Still 
more errors cause MSX-DOS to display the following message and inquire what 
to do with them. Press one of the keys A, R, or I.

2.2 Internal commands

Internal commands are assembly language programs grouped together in 
COMMAND.COM. It is not necessary to read them from the disk so they are 
executed fast. Following are 13 internal commands. This section describes 
their use.

        BASIC ........... jumps to MSX DISK-BASIC
        COPY ............ copies a file
        DATE ............ displays or modifies date
        DEL ............. deletes a files
        DIR ............. displays a list of files
        FORMAT .......... formats a disk
        MODE ............ modifies number of characters to be displayed
                          in one line
        PAUSE ........... pauses a batch command operation
        REM ............. puts a comment line in a batch command
        REN ............. renames a file name
        TIME ............ displays or modifies time
        TYPE ............ prints the contents of a file
        VERIFY .......... turns on/off the verify mode


* BASIC

form    BASIC [<file spec>]

Starts DISK-BASIC. This is not done by loading BASIC onto RAM but by 
selecting BASIC-ROM in 0000H to 7FFFH by switching the slot, so it starts 
immediately. When <file spec> is specified, the corresponding BASIC program 
is automatically read and executed. To return to the MSX-DOS environment from 
BASIC, execute "CALL SYSTEM".


* COPY

This command copies the contents of one file to another. Specifying 
parameters enables various options.


(1) File duplication

form    COPY <file spec 1> <file spec 2>

Duplicates the file specified by <file spec 1> into a file specified by <file 
spec 2>. Files having the same names cannot be created on the same disk. On 
different disks, specifying the same names is possible.

examples:


   A>COPY ABC XYZ       <-- copies file "ABC" and makes a file "XYZ".


   A>COPY B:ABC XYZ     <-- copies a file "ABC" on drive B and makes
                            a file "XYZ".

   A>COPY B:ABC C:XYZ   <-- copies a file "ABC" on drive B and makes
                            a file "XYZ" on drive C.

When copying files, either ASCII or binary mode may be selected. The "/A" 
swith specifies ASCII mode and the "/B" switch specifies binary mode. If no 
mode is specified, binary mode is selected by default (except when combining 
files, described in (4) below, when ASCII is the default mode). Table 3.8 
shows the differences between the ASCII and the binary modes.


   Table 3.8  ASCII mode and binary mode

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|           |       Read from source file       | Write to destination file |
|-----------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------|
|ASCII mode | ignore after 1AH (file end mark)  | add one byte 1AH to end   |
|Binary mode| read as long as physical file size| write without modification|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


examples:

   A>COPY/A ABC XYZ     <-- ABC to XYZ (both files are in ASCII mode)

   A>COPY ABC/A XYZ/B   <-- reads ABC in ASCII mode and writes it to XYZ
                            in binary mode


(2) File duplication to another disk drive

form    COPY <file spec> [<destination drive>:]

Copies a file specified by <file spec> to <destination drive> under the same 
file name. When <destination drive> is omitted, it is copied to the default 
drive. The drive name included in the <file spec> must not be the same as the 
<destination drive>.

More than one file can be copied by using wildcards in the <file spec>. In 
this case, the file name is displayed on the screen each time the file is 
copied.

examples:

   A>COPY *.COM B:      <-- copies any files with extension "COM"
                            on default drive to drive B

   A>COPY B:ABC         <-- copies a file ABC to default drive


(3) Simultaneous duplication of many files

form    COPY <file spec 1> <file spec 2>
             ------------- -------------
                   |             |
     wildcard description     wildcard description

When <file spec 2>, the destination, is described using wildcards, the 
portions corresponding to wildcards are replaced with corresponding 
characters in <file spec 1>. For example, when

   COPY AB-07.021 FL?X*.V??

is executed, it is interpreted as shown in figure 3.6 and a file "FL-X7.V21" 
is created.


   Figure 3.6  Wildcard specification of destination file

---------------------------------    -------------
| F | L | ? | X | ? | ? | ? | ? |    | V | ? | ? |  <file spec 2>
---------------------------------    -------------
  |   |       |                        |
  V   V       V                        V
---------------------------------    -------------  Only wildcard portion
| F | L | - | X | 7 |   |   |   |    | V | 2 | 1 |  is replaced with
---------------------------------    -------------  <file spec 1>
          ^       ^   ^   ^   ^            ^   ^
          |       |   |   |   |            |   |
---------------------------------    -------------
| A | B | - | 0 | 7 |   |   |   |    | 0 | 2 | 1 |  <file spec 1>
---------------------------------    -------------


Using wildcards in the specification of <file spec 1> enables the duplication 
of many files at the same time.

examples:

   A>COPY *.ASM *.MAC           <-- makes files with extension "MAC" from
                                    any files with extension "ASM"

   A>COPY A*.* B:Z*.*           <-- Any files beginning with the character
                                    A are copied to files beginning with
                                    the character Z on drive B


(4) File concatenation

form    COPY <multiple file spec> <file name>
             --------------------
                      |
           wildcard specification, or
           multiple file spec connected by "+"

When one destination file receives more than one source file, the contents of 
all source files are concatenated and stored to the specified destination 
file. When specifying more than one source file, wildcards are available, and 
file specs can also be copied by using the plus sign.

When files are concatenated, ASCII mode is selected by default and 1AH is 
considered the file end mark. Thus, concatenating binary files including data 
1AH by the COPY command causes data after 1AH to be discarded. To prevent 
this, specify /B switch and use COPY command in binary mode.

If more than one wildcard appears in the specification of source files, the 
second wildcard and after are expanded referring to original file names, as 
in paragraph (3) above. This permits concatenation of similar files at the 
same time.

examples:

   A>COPY X+Y+Z XYZ             <-- concatenates X, Y, AND Z and stores
                                    in a file XYZ

   A>COPY *.LST ALL             <-- concatenates any files with extension
                                    "LST" and stores in a file ALL

   A>COPY /B *.DAT ALL          <-- concatenates any ".DAT" files in
                                    binary mode

   A>COPY ASC/A+BIN/B AB/B      <-- concatenates an ASCII file ASC and a
                                    binary file BIN and stores in a
                                    file AB

   A>COPY *.LST+*.REF *.PRN     <-- concatenates files named same with
                                    extension "LST" and extension "REF"
                                    and makes a file with extension "PRN"


* DATE

form    DATE [<month>-<day>-<year>]
                     -     -
                     |     |
                     -------
                        |
           "/" and "." are also allowed.

Sets the date in the internal CLOCK-IC. For MSX machines without a CLOCK-IC, 
it is written to the specific work area. Creations or modifications of files 
on MSX-DOS cause this date information to be recorded for each file.

When the DATE command is executed without specifying <month>/<day>/<year>, 
the date currently set is displayed with a request for a new date as shown 
below. Pressing only the RETURN key here leaves the date unchanged.

        Current date is <day of week> <month>-<day>-<year>
        Enter new date:

The format of the date to be set by the DATE command has three fields: 
<year>, <month>, and <day>. Each field is separated by "-", "/", or ".". Each 
field can have the following numerical values:

        <year>:         1980 to 2079
                        0 to 79 (considered as 2000 to 2079)
                        80 to 99 (considered as 1980 to 1999)
        <month>:        1 to 12
        <day>:          1 to 31

Foreign versions of MSX-DOS have different date formats: <month>-<day>-<year> 
or <day>-<month>-<year>.


* DEL

form    DEL <file spec>
        ERASE is also allowed

Deletes the specified file. Wildcards can be used to specify more than one 
files.

Since "DEL *.*" causes all files on the diskette to be deleted, in this case, 
an acknowledgement is required.

        A>DEL *.*
        Are you sure (Y/N)?

Pressing "Y" or "y" causes all files to be deleted.

"ERASE" may be used the same way as the DEL command.


* DIR

form    DIR [<file spec>] [/W] [/P]

The following information about the specified at <file spec> is listed from 
the left side in one line.

        <file name> <file size> <date> <time>

The fields <date> and <time> show when the file was created or last 
modified. When this information is longer than one line, items displayed near 
the right side are omitted.

In addition to the usual wildcards, the following abbreviations for <file 
spec> can be used.

        Abbreviation                    Formal notation

        DIR                     =       DIR *.*
        DIR <drive>:            =       DIR <drive>:*.*
        DIR <filename>          =       DIR <filename>.*
        DIR .<extension>        =       DIR *.<extension>

When the /W switch is specified, only <filename>s are padded to one line. 
When the /P switch is specified, the listing is stopped after each display 
page to wait for any key input.

examples:

   A>DIR                <-- displays information for all files on drive A

   A>DIR B:             <-- displays information for all files on drive B

   A>DIR TEST           <-- displays information for all files
                            having <filename> "TEST"

   A>DIR /W             <-- displays all file names of drive A


* FORMAT

form    FORMAT

Formats a diskette in MSX-DOS format. In other words, directories and FAT are 
initialised and any files are erased. Since MSX-DOS has the same disk format 
as MS-DOS, the formatted diskette is also read or written by MS-DOS.

When executing the FORMAT command, an inquiry

        Drive name?  (A,B)      (<-- Depends on number of drives)

is made for the name of the drive containing a disk to be formatted. 
Answering "A" or "B" causes the menu to be displayed when a drive that can 
select one-sided and two-sided formats is being used. After specifying the 
type of format,

        Strike a key when ready

is displayed to wait for a key input. Pressing any key starts formatting. See 
the disk drive manual for the format menu.


* MODE

form    MODE <characters per line>

Sets the number of characters to be displayed in one line on the screen. 
<characters per line> can have a value from 1 to 80 and the screen mode 
depends on that value:

<characters per line>           Screen mode
        1 to 32                 GRAPHIC 1 (SCREEN 1)
       33 to 40                 TEXT 1 (SCREEN 0:WIDTH 40)
       41 to 80                 TEXT 2 (SCREEN 0:WIDTH 80)


* PAUSE

form    PAUSE [<comment>]

MSX-DOS has a "batch operation" feature which automatically executes a series 
of commands written in a text file. During the batch operation, you may want 
to stop command execution temporarily. One example would be for the user to 
exchange disks. PAUSE can be used in such cases.

When this command is executed,

        Strike a key when ready...

is displayed and a key input is expected. Pressing any key other than Ctrl-C 
here ends the PAUSE command and proceeds to the next one. Pressing CTRL-C 
abandons the batch operation. Any kind of comments can follow "PAUSE". This 
makes it possible to display the purpose of the request for the key input.


* REM

form    REM [<comment>]

REM is used to write a comment in the batch command. It does nothing as a 
command. A space between "REM" and <comment> is required.


* REN

form    REN <file spec> <file name>
        RENAME is also allowed

REN changes the file name specified by <file spec>. Wildcards can be used in 
both <file spec> and <file name>. Specifying wildcards for <file name> causes 
these wildcards to be replaced with corresponding characters of the <file 
spec> (see COPY command).

Any attempt to change a file name to a name already in use will cause an 
error.

examples:

   A>REN ABC XYZ      <-- changes the file name "ABC" to "XYZ"

   A>REN B:ABC XYZ    <-- changes the file name "ABC" on drive B to "XYZ"

   A>REN *.BIN *.COM  <-- changes any files with the extension "BIN" to "COM"


* TIME

form    TIME [<hour>[:<minute>[:<second>]]]

TIME sets the time for the internal CLOCK-IC. Nothing happens to machines 
that do not have a CLOCK-IC. When a file is created on MSX-DOS, time 
information set here is recorded for each file.

Executing the TIME command without specifying the time causes the current 
time setting to be displayed as shown below. Then there is an input request 
for a new time. Pressing only the RETURN key does not change the time.

        Current time is <hour>:<minute>:<second>:<second/100><p or a>
        Enter new time:

The punctuation mark ":" separates the three TIME command fields of <hour>, 
<minute>, and <second>. Fields after <minute> or <second> may be omitted or 
considered to be 0. Each field can have the following values:

        <hour>:    0 to 23
                   12A           (represents midnight)
                   0A to 11A     (represents midnight to 11 o'clock
                                  in the morning)
                   12P           (represents noon)
                   1P to 11P     (represents 1 o'clock to 11 o'clock
                                 in the evening)
        <minute>:  0 to 59
        <second>:  0 to 59

examples:

   A>TIME 12            <-- sets time to 12:00:00

   A>TIME 1:16P         <-- sets time to 13:16:00


* TYPE

form    TYPE <file spec>

The command TYPE displays the contents of a file specified by <file spec>. 
Using wildcards in <file spec> causes the first of the corresponding files to 
be displayed. This command is for ASCII files, and displaying binary files 
causes unreadable control characters to be sent to the screen.


* VERIFY

form    VERIFY [ON|OFF]

VERIFY sets/resets the verify mode. When the verify mode is turned ON, after 
data is written to the disk, it is always read to ensure that it was written 
correctly. This is why disk access takes longer. "VERIFY OFF" is set by 
default.


2.3  Batch Command Usage

MSX-DOS has a batch feature that allows a series of commands listed in the 
order of operation to be executed automatically. The file containing this 
procedureis called a "batch file" and the series of operations defined by a 
batch file is called a "batch command".

A batch file uses the extension ".BAT". Typing only the file name (the 
extension ".bat" is not typed) at the command line prompt causes MSX-DOS to 
execute the commands in the file line by line.

For example, let us consider the following operation:

1.  Copy all files on drive A with the extension ".COM" onto drive B.
2.  List all "COM" files on drive B.
3.  Delete all "COM" files on drive A.

This operation could be achieved by issuing the following commands to 
MSX-DOS:

A>COPY A:*.COM B:
A>DIR B:*.COM /W
A>DEL A:*.COM

If these three lines are combined into a batch file called "MV.BAT", the 
command line input "MV" will automatically execute the operation shown above. 
The following list illustrates this.

A>COPY CON MV.BAT  -+
COPY A:*.COM B:     | creates "MV.BAT"
DIR B:*.COM /W      |
DEL A:*.COM        -+
^Z                    Ctrl-Z + RETURN key input

A>TYPE MV.BAT      -+
COPY A:*.COM B:     | to confirm the contents of "MV.BAT"
DIR B:*.COM /W      |
DEL A:*.COM        -+

A>MV                  invokes the batch command "MV"
A>COPY A:*.COM B:     reads the first line automatically and executes it
        .
        .
        .
A>DIR B:*.COM /W      reads the second line automatically and executes it
        .
        .
        .
A>DEL A:*.COM         reads the third line automatically and executes it
        .
        .
        .

A batch operation may be interrupted by pressing Ctrl-C. When Ctrl-C is 
entered during batch operations, the request shown in Figure 3.7 is displayed 
on the screen.


   Figure 3.7  Interrupt of the batch operation

-----------------------------------
|                                 |
|   Terminate batch file (Y/N)?   |
|                                 |
-----------------------------------

Selecting "Y" here terminates the batch command and returns to MSX-DOS. 
Selecting "N" reads the next line of the batch file and continues the 
execution of the batch command.


* Batch variables

For more flexible use of the batch command, any string can be passed as 
parameters from the command line to the batch command. Parameters passed are 
referred to with the symbols "%n" where n is any number from 0 to 9. These 
"%n" symbols are called batch variables.

Batch variables %1, %2, ... correspond to parameters specified in the command 
line from left to right, and %0 is for the name of the batch command itself.


   Figure 3.8  Examples for batch variables usage

-----------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                               |
| A>COPY CON TEST.BAT ......... creates a batch command         |
| REM %0 %1 %2 %3                                               |
| ^Z                                                            |
|        1 file copied                                          |
| A>TYPE TEST.BAT                                               |
| REM %0 %1 %2 %3 ...... a batch command to display 3 arguments |
|                                                               |
| A>TEST ONE TWO THREE FOUR ...... executes the batch command,  |
| A>REM TEST ONE TWO THREE         giving arguments to it       |
| A>                                                            |
|                                                               |
-----------------------------------------------------------------


* AUTOEXEC.BAT

The batch file named "AUTOEXEC.BAT" is used as a special autostart program at 
MSX-DOS startup. When MSX-DOS is invoked, COMMAND.COM examines whether 
AUTOEXEC.BAT exists and, if so, executes it.


2.4 External Commands

External commands exist on the diskette as files with the extension ".COM", 
and typing the external command name (except for the extension) causes the 
command to be executed in the following manner.

1.  loads an external command after 100H
2.  calls 100H


* Developing external commands

Assembly language routines created to work in memory at location 100H and 
saved under file names with the extension ".COM" are called external commands 
and can be executed from MSX-DOS.

For example, consider a program to produce a control code "0CH" by using 
one-character output routine (see system calls) and clear the screen. This is 
an 8-byte program as shown below.


List 3.1  Contents of CLS.COM
=========================================================================

1E 0C           LD      E,0CH      ; E := control-code of CLS
0F 02           LD      C,02H      ; C := function No. of CONSOLE OUTPUT
CD 05 00        CALL    0005H      ; call BDOS
C9              RET

=========================================================================


Writing these 8 bytes to a file named CLS.COM produces the external command 
"CLS" to clear the screen. The following sample program uses the sequential 
file access feature of BASIC to make this command. After this program is run, 
the CLS command is created on the diskette. Confirm that the command actually 
works after returning to MSX-DOS.


List 3.2  Creating CLS.COM

=========================================================================

100 '***** This program makes "CLS.COM" *****
110 '
120 OPEN "CLS.COM" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
130 '
140 FOR I=1 TO 8
150   READ D$
160   PRINT #1,CHR$(VAL("&H"+D$));
170 NEXT
180 '
190 DATA 1E,0C,0E,02,CD,05,00,C9

=========================================================================


* Passing arguments to an external command

When creating an external command, there are two ways to pass arguments from 
the command line to the external command. First, when passing the file names 
to the command line as arguments, use 5CH and 6CH in the system scratch area. 
COMMAND.COM, which always considers the first and second parameters as file 
names when external commands are executed, expands them to a drive number (1 
byte) + file name (8 bytes) + extension (3 bytes) and stores them in 5CH and 
6CH. These are in the same format as the first 12 bytes of FCB, so setting 
these address as first addresses of FCB permits various operatuons.

However, since in this method only 16 bytes differ from the starting 
addresses of two FCBs, either 5CH or 6CH (only) can be used as a complete 
FCB. Next, when passing arguments other than file names (numbers, for 
instance) or creating an external command handling more than three file 
names, COMMAND.COM stores the whole command line, which invoked the external 
command, except for the command line itself in the form of number of bytes (1 
byte) + command line body, so it can be used by interpreting it in the 
external command properly. See List 3.3 of section 4 for an example of 
passing arguments using this DMA area.


3.  STRUCTURE OF DISK FILES

Information about the structure of data on the disk and how it is controlled 
is important when acessing the disk using system calls. This section begins 
with a description about "logical sectors" which are the basic units for 
exchanging data with the disk on MSX-DOS, and proceeds to the method of 
handling data with "files" which is more familiar to programmers.


3.1 Data units on the disk

* Sectors

MSX-DOS can access most types of disk drives including th 3.5 inch 2DD and 
hard disks. For handling different media in the same way, the system call 
consider "logical sector" as the basic units of data on the disk. A logical 
sector is specified by numbers starting from 0.


* Clusters

As long as system calls are used, a sector may be considered the basic unit 
of data as considered above. In fact, however, data on the disk is controlled 
in units of "clusters" which consists of multiple sectors. As described later 
in the FAT section, a cluster is specified by a serial number from 2 and the 
top of the data area corresponds to the location of cluster #2. For getting 
information about how many sectors a cluster has, use the system call 
function 1BH (acquiring disk information).


* Conversion from clusters to sectors

In a part of the directory or FCB, described later, the data location on the 
disk is indicated by the cluster. To use system calls to access data 
indicated by cluster, the relation of the correspondence between the cluster 
and the sector needs to be calculated. Since cluster #2 and the top sector of 
the data area reside in the same location, this can be done as follows:

1. Assume the given cluster number is C.
2. Examine the top sector of the data area (by reading DPB) and assume it is 
S0.
3. Examine the number of sectors equivalent to one cluster (using function 
1BH) and assume it is n.
4. Use the formula S = S0 + (C-2) * n to calculate sector numbers.

In MSX-DOS, sectors in the disk are divided into four areas, as shown in 
Table 3.9. The file data body written to the disk is recorded in the "data 
area" portion. Information for handling data is written in three areas. 
Figure 3.9 shows the relation of the locations of these areas. The boot 
sector is always in sector #0, but the top sectors (FAT, directory, and data 
area) differ by media, so DPB should be referred to.


   Table 3.9  Disk contents

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| boot sector | MSX-DOS startup program and information proper to the disk |
| FAT         | physical control information of data on the disk           |
| directory   | control information of files on the disk                   |
| data area   | actual file data                                           |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   +- ----------------------- <-- last sector


* DPB (drive parameter block) and boot sector

On MSX-DOS, the area "DPB" is allocated in the work area of memory for each 
connected drive, and information proper to each drive is recorded there. 
MSX-DOS can handle most types of disk drives, because the differences between 
media can be compensated for by the process corresponding to each drive.

Information written on DPB, which is originally on the boot sector (sector 
#0) of the disk, is read at MSX-DOS startup. Note that the differences 
between the contents of the boot sector and DPB, as shown in Figures 3.10 and 
3.11. Data is arranged differently in the boot sector and the DPB.

Use the system call Function 1BH (disk information acquisition) to access the 
DPB. This system call returns the DPB address in memory and other information 
for each drive written on the boot sector (see section 4 "System call usage" 
for the detailed usage).


* FAT (file allocation table)

In MSX-DOS, a "cluster" is the data unit for writing to the disk. Files 
larger than a cluster are written across multiple clusters. But in this case 
adjacent clusters are not always used. In particular, after creating and 
deleting files many times, clusters which are no longer used are scattered at 
random across the disk. When a large file is created for such cases, the file 
is broken down into several clusters and these clusters are stored where 
space is available. The linkage information is kept at the beginning so that 
the file can be recreated. This is the main function of the FAT.

When a bad cluster is found, FAT is also used to record that location, so 
access will not be made there any more. Linkage information of clusters and 
information concerning bad clusters is necessary for managing disk files. 
Without this information, the whole disk will be unusable. For this reason, 
more than one FAT is always prepared in case of accidental erasure.


Figure 3.2 shows an example of a FAT. The first byte is called the "FAT ID" 
which contains the value indicating the type of media (the same value as 
media ID in Table 3.1). The next two bytes contains meaningless dummy values. 
From the fourth byte (start address + 3), actual linkage information is 
recorded in an irregular format of 12 bits per cluster. Each 12-bit area 
containing linkage information is called a FAT entry. Note that the FAT entry 
begins with number 2. The number of the FAT entry is also the number of the 
cluster corresponding to it. Read the 12-bit linkage information recorded in 
the FAT entry in the way shown in Figure 3.13.

                        ---------


The linkage information is the value indicating the next cluster number. FFFH 
means that the file ends with that cluster. The example of Figure 3.12 shows 
a file of three clusters, (cluster #2 -> cluster #3 -> cluster #4), and a 
file of two clusters, (cluster #5 -> cluster #6). The linkage from the 
cluster with the smaller number is only for easy comprehension. In actual 
practice, numbers are not necessarily ordered.

* Directory

The FAT as described above, relates the physical location of data on the disk 
and does not include information about the contents of data written there. 
Thus, an information resource other than FAT is required to know what kind of 
data is in a file. This resource is called a "directory". A directory entry 
is composed of 32 bytes and records file names, file attributes, date 
created, time created, number of the top cluster of the file, and file size, 
as shown in Figure 3.14.

"File attributes" in the directory are used for specifying the invisibility 
attribute in a file. Specifying "1" in the second bit from the lowest of this 
byte prevents files specified in the directory from being accessed by the 
system call (see Figure 3.15). MS-DOS also has a file attribute byte which 
permits a write-prohibit attribute using another bit, but MSX-DOS does not 
support this feature.

The date and time are recorded so that two bytes of each are divided into 
three bitfields, as shown in Figure 3.16 and Figure 3.17. Since only 5 bits 
are prepared for the "time" bitfield, the minimum unit for time is two 
seconds. The year (1980 to 2079) is specified by using 0 to 99 in 7 bits.

The place where this directory information is actually recorded is the 
directory area on the disk (see Figure 3.9). The location (top sector) is 
recorded in the DPB. Directory entries (locations of directory storage) are 
arranged every 32 bytes in the driectory area, as shown in Figure 3.18. When 
a file is created, the directory is created at the lowest value of unused 
directory entries. Deleting a file causes E5H to be written to the first byte 
of the corresponding directory entry, which is empty. After all direcotry 
entries are exhausted, new files cannot be created even if there is a lot of 
unused space on the disk. The number of directory entries, that is, the 
number of files which can be created on one disk is also recorded in the DPB.

3.2 File Access

* FCB (file control block)

Using information recorded in the directory area allows data to be treated as 
a "file". The advantage of this method is that the data location is not 
represented by an absolute number such as sector number or cluster number; 
instead, the file can be specified with a "name". The programmer need only 
specify the file name and the system will do all the work concerned with 
accessing the requested file. In other words, the programmer need not 
understand the details of which sectors the file occupies. In this case, FCB 
plays an important role for directories.

FCB is the area for storing information needed to handle files using system 
calls. Handling one file requires 37 bytes of memory each, as shown in Figure 
3.19. Although the FCB can be located anywhere in memory, the address 005CH 
is normally used to utilize MSX-DOS features.

Notes: FCB usages differ, depending on whether they use CP/M compatible 
system calls or additional system calls. See the decription below for 
details.

(1) When using version 2 of MSX-DOS, here is stored the volume-id of the 
disk, and should not be modified by the program.
(2) When using version 2 of MSX-DOS, here is stored internal information 
relative to the physical location of the file on the disk. The format of this 
information is different from shown in figure 3.19, and should not be 
modified by the program.


* drive number (00H)
Indicates the disk drive containing the file.
(0 -> default drive, 1 -> A:, 2 -> B:...)

* filename (01H to 08H)
A filename can have up to 8 characters. When it has less than 8, the rest are 
filled in by spaces (20H).

* extension (09H to 0BH)
A extension can have up to 8 characters. When it has less than 3, the rest 
are filled in by spaces (20H).

* current block (0CH to 0DH)
Indicates the block number currently being referred to by sequential access 
(see function 14H, 15H in section 4).

* record size (0EH to 0FH)
Specifies the size of data unit (record) to be read or written at one access, 
in bytes (see function 14H, 15H, 21H, 27H, 28H).

* file size (10H to 13H)
Indicates the size of the file in bytes.

* date (14H to 15H)
Indicates date when a file was last written. The format is the same as the 
one recorded in the directory.

* time (16H to 17H)
Indicates time when a file was last written. The format is the same as the 
one recorded in the directory.

* device ID (18H)
When a peripheral is opened as a file, the value shown in Table 3.10 is 
specified for this device ID field. For normal disk files, the value of this 
field is 40H + drive number. For example, the device ID for drive A is 40H 
(for future expansion, application programs should not use the ID byte).


   Table 3.10  Device ID

----------------------------------
|    Device name     | Device ID |
|--------------------+-----------|
| CON (Console)      |    0FFH   |
| PRN (Printer)      |    0FBH   |
| LST (List=Printer) |    0FCH   |
| AUX (Auxiliary)    |    0FEH   |
| NUL (Null)         |    0FDH   |
----------------------------------


* directory location (19H)
Indicates the order of the directory entries of a file in the directory area.

* top cluster (1AH to 1BH)
Indicates the top cluster of the file in the disk.

* last cluster accessed (1C to 1DH)
Indicates the last cluster accessed.

* relative location from top cluster of last cluster accessed (1EH to 1FH)
Indicates the relative location from the top cluster of the last cluster 
accessed.

* current record (20H)
Indicates the record currently being referred to by sequential access (see 
function 14H, 15H).

* random record (21H to 24H)
Specifies a record  to be accessed by random access or random block access. 
Specifying a value from 1 to 63 for the record size field described above 
causes all four bytes from 21H to 24H to be used, where only three bytes from 
21H to 23H have meaning when the record size is greater than 63 (see function 
14H, 15H, 21H, 22H, 27H, 28H).


* Opening a file

A special procedure is required to open a file when using FCB. "Opening a 
file" means, at the system call level, transforming the incomplete FCB whose 
file name field is only defined for the complete FCB, by using information 
written in the directory area. Figure 3.20 shows the differences between 
"unopened FCB" and "opened FCB".

* Closing a file

When a file is opened and written to, the contents of each field of FCB, such 
as size, is also modified. Unless the updated FCB information is returned to 
the directory area, directory information and the actual contents of the file 
might be different at the next file access. This operation to return the 
updated FCB information to the directory corresponds to closing a file at the 
system call level.


* Random block access (file management by records)

MSX-DOS has two system calls dealing with random access, "RANDOM BLOCK READ" 
and "RANDOM BLOCK WRITE". With these system calls, a file can be divided into 
data units of any size, which can be handled by numbers, such as 0, 1, 2, 
..., from the top. This data unit is called a "record". Record size can be 
any value of more than one byte. So, treating a whole file as one record 
(extreme sequential access), treating data with one byte as one record 
(extreme random access), or treating 128 bytes as one record (the CP/M way) 
are all possible.

In this case, the FCB fields, "record size" and "random record" are used to 
specify the record. The value of the record size field is the number of bytes 
in one record. Random record fields can have any record number to be accessed 
(for more detailed usage, see descriptions of each system call).


   Figure 3.21  File and record

   +--                +- ----------------
   |      record size |  |  record  #0  |
   |                  +- |--------------|      -----------------
   |                     |  record  #1  | <--- | random record |
   |                     |--------------|      -----------------
   |                     |  record  #2  |        point to the
 whole                   |--------------|        record currently
 file                    |      .       |        accessed
   |                            .
   |                            .
   |                     |              |
   |                     |--------------|
   |                     |  record  #n  |
   +--                   ----------------


* Sequential access (file management by fixed-length record + current record 
+ current block)

MSX-DOS can also access files the same way as CP/M for purposes of 
compatibility. One way is the sequential file which is managed by "current 
record" and "current block". This uses a 128-byte fixed-length record as the 
basic unit of data. File access is always done from the top sequentially and 
the number of records which was accessed is counted at the current record 
field of FCB. The value of the current record field is reset to 0 when it 
reaches 128, and the carry is counted in the current block field.


* Random access (file management by fixed-length record + random record)

A second method included to keept compatibility with CP/M is a random access 
method using random record fields. It can access the record of any location 
but the record size is fixed at 128 bytes.


4.  SYSTEM CALL USAGE

The system calls are a collection of general-purpose subroutines which handle 
the basic input/output operations of MSX-DOS. Having these system calls 
gathered into BIOS in a predefined manner permits the basic functions of the 
MSX disk system to be easily accessed.

There are two purposes of system calls; first, to reduce programming time by 
preprogramming basic functions; second, to increase portability by the fact 
that all programs share the same basic functions. Utilizing system calls 
shortens program development time and makes the developed program highly 
portable.

To execute a system call, enter the defined function number in the C register 
of the Z80 CPU and call one of the following addresses:

        0005H ................. MSX-DOS
        F37DH (&HF37D) ........ MSX DISK-BASIC

For example, when the function number is 01FH and the system call requires 
00H to be set in the A register, the following assembler code can be used 
with MSX-DOS:

        LD      A,00H
        LD      C,01FH
        CALL    0005H
         .
         .
         .

The CALL statement is also used in operations that return values or restore 
registers from memory. System calls can also be used from DISK-BASIC by using 
the entry address of F37DH. For this case, store the machine codes in the 
area allocated by the CLEAR statement and call its start address using the 
USR function.


* System call format

This section introduces system call usages in the following notation:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Function:     function number                                            |
| Setup:        value needed to be set in register or memory by programmer |
| Return value: value set in register by system call                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Function:

The function number is used to identify the system call. When using a system 
call, set the function number in the C register.


Setup:

In this section, "setup:" indicates the value to be set in the named register 
or memory location before executing system calls.


Return value:

The result obtained by a system call is normally set in a register or memory 
location. This is called output in this section and "return value:" indicates 
where and how this output is set.

Is important to note that when using system calls, the contents of registers 
other than those specified are sometimes destroyed. So, before using system 
calls, store the contents of registers whose value you do not want to change 
in an appropriate place (stack, for example) before executing system calls.

There are forty-two MSX system calls. These are listed in Table 3.11, and are 
described in this section. There are four categories:

        * Peripheral I/O
        * Environment setting
        * Absolute READ/WRITE (direct access to sector)
        * File access using FCB

* Note

System call function numbers are from 00H to 30H; the following seven numbers 
are blank:

        1CH to 20H, 25H, 29H

Calling these blank funtion system calls do nothing except setting 00H in the 
A register. System calls after function 31H are undefined. Using them may 
cause unpredictable results (not advisable).

4.1 Peripheral I/O

The following system calls are intended for input/output operations. Some 
examples include console I/O (screen/keyboard), auxiliary I/O (external 
input/output), and printer I/O. Since subroutines such as getting information 
from the keyboard or controlling printers are necessary for most programs, 
you will find the system calls described in this section useful for general 
programming.


* Console input

Function:       01H
Setup:          none
Return value:   A register <-- one character from console

When there is no input (no key pressed and input buffer empty), an input is 
wait for. Input characters are echoed back to the console. The following 
control character input is allowed: Ctrl-C causes program execution to be 
halted and a return to the MSX-DOS command level; Ctrl-P causes any sucessive 
input to also echoed to the printer until Ctrl-N is accepted; Ctrl-S causes 
the display to stop until any key is pressed.

        Ctrl-C ........ system reset
        Ctrl-P ........ printer echo

        Ctrl-S ........ pause display


* Console output

Function:       02H
Setup:          E register <-- character code to be sent out
Return value:   none

This system call displays the character specified by the E register on the 
screen. It also checks the four control characters, listed above.


* External input

Function:       03H
Setup:          none
Return value:   A register <-- one character from AUX device

This system call checks four control characters.


* External output

Function:       04H
Setup:          E register <-- character code to send to AUX device
Return value:   none

This system call checks four control characters.


* Printer output

Function:       05H
Setup:          A register <-- one character from console

This system call does not echo back. It treats control characters in the same 
way as function 01H.


* Direct console input/output

Function:       06H
Setup:          E register <-- character code to be send to the console
                When 0FFH is specified, the character will be input
                from the console.
Return value:   When the E register is set to 0FFH (input), the result of
                input is in the A register. The value set in the A register
                is the character code of the key, if it was pressed;
                otherwise, the value is 00H. When the E register is set to
                a value other than 0FFH (output), there is no return value.

This system call does not support control characters and does not echo back 
input. This system call checks four control characters.


* Direct console input - 1

Function:       07H
Setup:          none
Return value:   A register <-- one character from console

This system call does not support control characters, nor echo back.


* Direct console input - 2

Function:       08H
Setup:          none
Return value:   A register <-- one character from console

This system call does not echo back. It treats control characters in the same 
way as function 01H.


* String output

Function:       09H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of string, prepared on
                                memory, to be sent to the console.
Return value:   none

24H ("$") is appended to the end of the string as the end symbol. This system 
call checks and performs four control character functions, as listed 
previously.


* String input

Function:       0AH
Setup:          The address of memory where the maximum number of input
                characters (1 to 0FFH) is set should be set in the DE
                register.
Return value:   Number of characters actually sent from console is set in the
                address, one added to the address indicated by the DE
                register; string sent from console is set in the area from
                the address, two added to the address indicated by the DE
                register.

Return key input is considered as the end of console input. However, when the 
number of input characters exceeds the specified number of characters 
(contents indicated by DE register, 1 to 255), characters within the 
specified number of characters will be treated as an input string and set in 
memory, and the operation ends. The rest of characters including the return 
key are ignored. Editing with the template is available to string input using 
this system call. This system call checks and performs four control character 
function, as listed previously.


* Console status check

Function:       0BH
Setup:          none
Return value:   0FFH is set in the A register when the keyboard is being
                pressed; otherwise, 00H is set.

This system call checks and performs four control character function, as 
listed previously.


4.2 Environment Setting and Readout

The following system calls set the MSX system environment; for example, 
changing the default drive, or setting various default values of the system.


* System reset

Function:       00H
Setup:          none
Return value:   none

When this is called in MSX-DOS, the system is reset by jumping to 0000H. When 
MSX DISK-BASIC call this, it is "warm started". That is, it returns to BASIC 
command level without destroying programs currently loaded.


* Version number acquisition

Function:       0CH
Setup:          none
Return value:   HL register <-- 0022H

This system call is for acquiring various CP/M version numbers, on MSX-DOS, 
however, 0022H is always returned.


* Disk reset

Function:       0DH
Setup:          none
Return value:   none

If there is a sector which has been changed but not written to the disk, this 
system call writes it to the disk, then it sets the default drive to drive A 
and sets DMA to 0080H.


* Default drive setting

Funtion:        0EH
Setup:          E register <-- default drive number (A = 00H, B = 01H, ...)
Return value:   none

Disk access by the system calls are made to the drive indicated by the 
default drive number, unless otherwise specified. Note that, when the drive 
number, which is set in the FCB specified upon calling the system call, is 
other than 00H, the default drive setting made by this system call is 
ignored.


* Login vector acquisition

Function:       18H
Setup:          none
Return value:   HL register <-- online drive information

The online drive is the drive connected to MSX normally when the disk system 
is booted up. Executing this system call causes each drive to be examined 
whether it is online, and the result is returned in the HL register as shown 
in Figure 3.22. When the bit is "1", the corresponding drive is online; 
otherwise it is not.

* Setting of address to be transferred to

Function:       1AH
Setup:          DE register <-- address setting to be transferred to
                                (DMA address)
Return value:   none

Though DMA address is initialized to 0080H at system reset, it can be reset 
to any address by using this system call.


* Disk information acquisition

Function:       1BH
Setup:          E register <-- number of the objective drive
                               (default drive = 00H, A = 01H, B = 02H, ...)
Return value:   A register <-- number of logical sectors per one cluster
                               (FFH if E register is set inappropriate)
                BC register <-- logical sector size
                DE register <-- amount of clusters
                IX register <-- DPB starting address
                IY register <-- FAT starting address on memory

This system call gets the information about the disk in the specified drive. 
Specifying 00H for the drive number specifies the default drive. For other 
than that, specify 01H for drive A, 02H for drive B, and so on.

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.

Return value:   HL register <-- year
                D register <-- month
                E register <-- day of month
                A register <-- day of week

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.


* Date setting

Function:       2BH
Setup:          HL register <-- year
                D register <-- month
                E register <-- day of month
Return value:   A indicates whether the system call has done succesfully. If 
                successful, the A register is set to 00H; otherwise, 0FFH.

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.


* Time acquisition

Function:       2CH
Setup:          none

                E register <-- 1/100 second
Return value:   If successful, the A register is set to 00H; otherwise, 0FFH

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.


* Verify flag setting

Function:       2EH
Setup:          E register <-- 00H, when resetting verify flag
                E register <-- value other than 00H, when setting
                               the verify flag
Return value:   none

Setting the verify flag causes successive writing to the disk to be done in 
mode "verify on". That is, by reading the contents written on the disk, the 
check is made to compare them with the contents to be written.

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.


4.3 Absolute READ/WRITE (direct access to sectors)

MSX manages the disk with the "logical sector" as a minimum unit. The logical 
sector is defined independent of the physical secotrs of the disk, and is 
numbered from 0 to the maximum logical sector (maximum number depends on the 
kind of the disks).

Logical sectors enable users of MSX-DOS or MSX DISK-BASIC to access the disk 
without being concerned about the number of physical sectors per track, where 
that number depends on the media type of the disk. In fact, by utilizing 
system calls which use FCB (file control block), the file can be easily 
handled in detail even without considering logical sectors, so the user does 
not even need to use logical sectors. But for some purposes, access using 
logical sectors is desirable, so MSX-DOS ans MSX DISK-BASIC offer system 
calls which can access logical sectors.

This section describes the system calls which access the disk by use of 
logical sectors.


* Reading from the disk using logical sectors

Function:       2FH
Setup:          The logical sector number to be read from (for more than
                one logical sector, the starting logical sector number)
                should be set in the DE register. The number of logical
                sectors to be read should be set in the H register, and
                the drive number (00H for drive A, 01H for drive B, and
                so on. The same follows for function 30H below) to be used
                to read should be set in the L register.
Return value:   The contents read are set in the DMA buffer.

This system call reads out a specified number of continuous logical sectors 
from the specified logical sector of the specified drive and stores the 
contents in memory after DMA. It then stores the contents of what it has read 
in memory after DMA. Function 1AH (which specifies the address it is to be 
transferred to) assures that there is enough available space in memory.

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.


* Writing to the disk using logocal sectors

Function:       30H
Setup:          Contents to be written should be set in memory area after
                the address indicated by DMA. The logical sector number from
                where the writing begins should be set in the DE register.
                The number of logical sectors to be written should be set
                in the H register. The drive number to be written to should
                be set in the L register.
Return value:   none

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.

4.4 File Access Using FCB

Since accessing a file is difficult when using the system calls described in 
the previous section (which read and write logical sectors directly), system 
calls using FCB are needed to easier access the disk by specifying files.

There are three categories of system calls using FCB. First is sequential 
file access and second is random file access, both are offered to maintain 
CP/M compatibility. The third is what gives MSX-DOS its power: random block 
access. This method is not available in CP/M. Random block access has the 
following features:

        * Any record size can be specified
        * Random access can be made to multiple records
        * File size can be controlled in bytes

This section describes system calls for file access using FCB, including 
random block access. Note that the following three functions do not work 
correctly when FCB is in the address range 4000H to 7FFFH:

        1. Function call 11H
        2. Function call 12H
        3. Input/output for devices (CON, PRN, NUL, AUX)


* Opening files

Function:       0FH
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of FCB which is not opened
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when a file is opened
                succeessfully; otherwise 0FFH is set. When a file is opened
                successfully, each field of the FCB is set.

When 00H is specified for a drive number, the default drive set by function 
0EH (default drive setting) is used. To open a file on another drive, specify 
01H for drive A, 02H for drive B and so on.

When a file is opened by this system call, all FCB fields except record size, 
current block, current record, and random record are set using information 
from the directory area on the disk. Fields which are not set should be set 
by the user after executing this system call, if needed. The state that each 
field of FCB is set is "the state that file is opened" when using system 
calls using FCB, and, in this case, system calls which access the file using 
FCB, described below, can be used.


* Closing files

Function:       10H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when file is closed
                scuccessfully; otherwise, 0FFH is set.

By writing the current contents of FCB in memory to the corresponding 
directory area on the disk, file information can be kept current. When the 
file is only read, it does not need to be closed by using this system call.


* File search - 1

Function:       11H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of FCB which is not opened
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when the file is found;
                otherwise 0FFH is set. When the file is found, the directory
                entry (32 bytes) of the file on the disk is set in the area
                indicated by DMA, and FCB drive number is set (thus, 33 bytes
                are used).

Wildcard characters can be used in the name of the file. For example, a 
specification "????????.c" causes any file name with an extension of "c" to 
be searched for, and the directory information of the file first found is 
written in after DMA. To find all matching files or to see whether there is 
only one matching file, use function 12H described below.


* File search - 2

Function:       12H
Setup:          none
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when the file is found;
                otherwise 0FFH is set. When the file is found, the directory
                entry (32 bytes) of the file on the disk is set in the area
                indicated by DMA, and the FCB drive number is set
                (thus, 33 bytes are used).

This system call should be used to search for multiple files meeting the file 
name specification by wildcard characters in function 11H. So this function 
should not be used by itself.

This system call allows the directory information of files meeting the 
specifications in function 11H to be listed in order, one by one.


* Deleting files

Function:       13H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of FCB which is not opened
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when file is successfully
                deleted., otherwise 0FFH is set.

Using wildcard characters for the file name may cause more than one file to 
be deleted. Exercise caution when using wildcards to delete files.


* Sequential readout

Function:       14H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
                FCB current block <-- starting block for readout
                FCB current record <-- starting record for readout
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when readout is successful;
                otherwise 01H is set. When successful, one record which has
                been read is set in the area indicated by DMA.

The FCB current block and record will be updated automatically after the 
readout. That is, in successive readouts, the current block and record do not 
need to be set. The record size for readout is fixed at 128 bytes.


* Sequential writing to the disk

Function:       15H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
                FCB current block <-- starting block for writing
                FCB current record <-- starting record for writing
                128 bytes starting from DMA <-- data to be written
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when writing is successful;
                otherwise 01H is set.

The FCB current block and record will be updated automatically after the 
readout.


* Creating files

Function:       16H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of FCB which is not opened
Retu4rn value:  00H is set in the A register when the file is created
                successfully; otherwise 0FFH is set.

The record size, current block and record, and the random record of the FCB 
should be set after executing this system call.


* Renaming files

Function:       17H
Setup:          New file name should be set within 11 bytes after the
                18th byte of the FCB (2nd byte of file size field
                of FCB = 16 bytes after old file name) corresponding to
                old file name (that is, it should be set in 18th to 28th
                byte), the FCB address should be set in the DE register.
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when the file name is renamed
                successfully; otherwise 0FFH is set.

Wildcard characters can be used for both the new and old file names. For 
example, specifying "????????.o" for the old file name and "????????.obj" for 
the new file name causes the extension of all files having ".o" to be changed 
to ".obj".


* Random reading from the disk

Function:       21H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
                random record in FCB <-- record for readout
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when readout is successful;
                otherwise 01H is set. When successful, the contents of one
                record which has been read are set in the area indicated
                by DMA.

The lenght of the record is fixed to 128 bytes.


* Random writing to the disk

Function:       22H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
                random record in FCB <-- record to be written to
                128 bytes starting from DMA <-- data to be written
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when writing is successful;
                otherwise 01H is set.

The lenght of the record is fixed to 128 bytes.


* File size acquisition

Function:       23H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of FCB which is not opened
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when the function is successful;
                otherwise 00H is set. When successful, the size of the
                specified file is set in increments of 128 bytes, in the
                first three bytes of the random record field.

The file size is calculated in increments of 128 bytes. That is, 2 would be 
set for files ranging in size from 129 bytes to 256 bytes. Thus a file with 
257 bytes would return a value of 3.


* Random record field setting

Function:       24H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
                FCB current block <-- objective block
                FCB current record <-- objective record
Return value:   Current record position, calculated from the current block
                and record fields of specified FCB, is set in the random
                record field.


* Random writing to the disk - 2 (random block access)

Function:       26H
Setup:          DE register <-- the starting address from the FCB
                FCB record size <-- size of record to be written
                FCB random record <-- the record ID number
                HL register <-- the number of records to be written
                DMA memory buffer <-- the data to be written
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when writing is successful;
                otherwise 01H is set.

After writing to the disk, the value of the random record field is 
automatically updated and points to the next record. The size of one record 
can be set to any value from 1 byte to 65535 bytes by setting the desired 
value in the FCB record size field. When 0 records are to be written, the 
file lenght is calculated at the record size multiplied by the record number. 
The rest is discarded.

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.


* Random readout - 2 (random block access)

Function:       27H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
                FCB record size <-- record size to be read
                FCB random record <-- record to start reading
                HL register <-- number of records to be read
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when data is read successfully;
                otherwise 01H is read. The number of records actually read
                is set back in the HL register. When this number is almost
                one, the data which has been read is set in the area
                indicated by DMA.

After readout, the random record field is automatically updated. After 
executing this system call, the total number of records actually read is set 
in the HL register. That is, if the end of file is reached before the 
specified number of records have been read, the actual number of records read 
will be returned in the HL register.    

This system call has been created for MSX-DOS and is not compatible with 
CP/M.


* Random writing - 3

Function:       28H
Setup:          DE register <-- starting address of opened FCB
                FCB random record <-- record to be written
                128 bytes in DMA buffer <-- data to be written
Return value:   00H is set in the A register when writing is successful;
                otherwise, 01H is set.

The lenght of records is fixed at 128 bytes.

This system call is the same as 22H except for one point. When the file 
becomes large, 00H is written to the added records coming before the 
specified record.
