APPENDIX 1 - BIOS LISTING

This chapter lists the 126 BIOS entries available to the user.

There are two kinds of BIOS routines, the ones in MAIN-ROM and the ones in 
SUB-ROM. They each have different calling sequences which will be described 
later. The following is the entry notation.


Label name (address)    *n
  Function:   descriptions and notes about the function
  Input:      parameters used by call
  Output:     parameters returned by call
  Registers:  registers which will be used (original contentes are lost)


The value of *n has the following meanings.

    *1 ... same as MSX1
    *2 ... call SUB-ROM internally in screen modes 5 to 8
    *3 ... always call SUB-ROM
    *4 ... do not call SUB-ROM while screen modes 4 to 8 are changed

Routines without "*n" are appended for MSX2.



MAIN-ROM
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To call routines in MAIN-ROM, the CALL or RTS instruction is used as an 
ordinary subroutine call.



* RSTs

Among the following RSTs, RST 00H to RST 28H are used by the BASIC 
interpreter. RST 30H is used for inter-slot calls and RST 38H is used for 
hardware interrupts.


CHKRAM (0000H)          *1
  Function:     tests RAM and sets RAM slot for the system
  Input:        none
  Output:       none
  Registers:    all


SYNCHR (0008H)          *1
  Function:     tests whether the character of [HL] is the specified
                character. If not, it generates SYNTAX ERROR, otherwise it
                goes to CHRGTR (0010H).
  Input:        set the character to be tested in [HL] and the character to
                be compared next to RST instruction which calls this routine
                (inline parameter).

                Example:        LD      HL,LETTER
                                RST     08H
                                DB      "A"
                                         .
                                         .
                                         .
                        LETTER: DB      "B"

  Output:       HL is increased by one and A receives [HL]. When the tested
                character is numerical, the CY flag is set; the end of the
                statement (00H or 3AH) causes the Z flag to be set.
  Registers:    AF, HL


RDSLT (000CH)           *1
  Function:     selects the slot corresponding to the value of A and reads
                one byte from the memory of the slot. When this routine is
                called, the interrupt is inhibited and remains inhibited
                even after execution ends.
  Input:        A for the slot number.

                 F000EEPP
                 -   ----
                 |   ||++-------------- Basic slot number (0 to 3)
                 |   ++---------------- Expansion slot number (0 to 3)
                 +--------------------- "1" when using expansion slot

                HL for the address of memory to be read
  Output:       the value of memory which has been read in A
  Registers:    AF, BC, DE


CHRGTR (0010H)          *1
  Function:     gets a character (or a token) from BASIC text
  Input:        [HL] for the character to be read
  Output:       HL is incremented by one and A receives [HL]. When the
                character is numerical, the CY flag is set; the end of the
                statement causes the Z flag to be set.
  Registers:    AF, HL


WRSLT (0014H)           *1
  Function:     selects the slot corresponding to the value of A and writes
                one byte to the memory of the slot. When this routine is
                called, interrupts are inhibited and remain so even after
                execution ends.
  Input:        specifies a slot with A (same as RDSLT)
  Output:       none
  Registers:    AF, BC, D

                   sends output to the printer when PTRFLG (F416H) is other
                    than 0
                   sends output to the file specified by PTRFIL (F864H) when
                    PTRFIL is other than 0

  Registers:    AF


ENASLT (0024H)          *1
  Function:     selects the slot corresponding to the value of A and enables
                the slot to be used. When this routine is called, interrupts
                are inhibited and remain so even after execution ends.
  Input:        specify the slot by A (same as RDSLT)
                specify the page to switch the slot by 2 high order bits
                of HL

                TMS9918, so only the 14 low order bits of the VRAM address
                are valid. To use all bits, see BIGFIL.
  Input:        HL for VRAM address to begin writing, BC for the length of
                the area to be written, A for data.

APPENDIX 2 - MATH-PACK

The Math-Pack is the core for the mathematical routines of MSX-BASIC and, by 
calling these routines from an assembly language program, floating-point 
operations and trigonometrical functions are available.

Any operations involving real numbers in Math-Pack are done in BCD (Binary 
Coded Decimal). There are two ways of expressing a real number, "single 
precision" and "double precision"; a single precision real number (6 digits) 
is expressed by 4 bytes and a double precision real number (14 digits) by 8 
bytes (see Figure A.1 and Figure A.2).

A real number consists of a sign, an exponent, and a mantissa. The sign 
represents the sign of the mantissa; 0 for positive, 1 for negative. The 
exponent is a binary expression and can be expressed as a power from +63 to 
-63, with an excess of 64 (see Figure A.3). Figure A.4 shows the valid range 
of double precision real numbers.

In Math-Pack, the memory is predefined for operation. This memory area is 
called "DAC (Decimal ACumulator (F7F6H)" and the area which reserves the 
numerical value to be operated is called "ARG (F847H)". For example, in 
multiplication, the product of the numbers in DAC and ARG is calculated and 
the result is returned in the DAC.

In the DAC, single precision real numbers, double precision real numbers, and 
two-byte integers can be stored. In order to distinguish them, "VALTYP 
(F663H)" is used and its value is 4 for single precision real numbers, 8 for 
double precision real numbers, and 2 for two-byte integers.

Single and double precision numbers must be stored from the top of the DAC. 
For two-byte integers, the low and high bytes should be stored in DAC + 2 and 
DAC + 3.

Since Math-Pack is an internal routine of BASIC, when an error occurs (such 
as division by 0 or overflow), control automatically jumps to the 
corresponding error routine, then returns to BASIC command level. To prevent 
this, change H.ERRO (FFB1H).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: (HL), (DE) means the values in memory pointed to by HL or DE. Four
      register names in the parentheses are the single precision real numbers
      which indicate (sign + exponent), (mantissa 1st and 2nd places),
      (mantissa 3th and 4th places), (mantissa 5th and 6th places) from left
      to right. Where the object is VALTYP, the movement (2, 4, 8 bytes) is
      according to the type indicated in VALTYP (F663H).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Results will be in A register. Meanings of A register are:

               A = 1    -->     left < right
               A = 0    -->     left = right
               A = -1   -->     left > right

      In the comparison of single precision real numbers, CBED means that
      each register has single precision (sign + exponent),
      (mantissa 1st and 2nd places), (mantissa 3th and 4th places), and
      (mantissa 5th and 6th places).

APPENDIX 3 - BIT BLOCK TRANSFER

The bit block transfer corresponds to the COPY command in BASIC and is used 
to transfer data from RAM, VRAM, and the disk. It is easily executed by the 
routine in expansion ROM and available from the assembly language program. 
Since it is in expansion ROM, use SUBROM or EXTROM of BIOS for this routine.


1. Transferring in VRAM

* BLTVV (0191H/SUB)

  Function:     transfers data in VRAM area

  Input:        HL register <-- F562H
                The following parameters should be set:

                * SX (F562H, 2)         X-coordinate of the source
                * SY (F564H, 2)         Y-coordinate of the source
                * DX (F566H, 2)         X-coordinate of the destination
                * DY (F568H, 2)         Y-coordinate of the destination
                * NX (F56AH, 2)         number of dots in the X direction
                * NY (F56CH, 2)         number of dots in the Y direction
                * CDUMMY (F56EH, 1)     dummy (not required to be set)
                * ARG (F56FH, 1)        selects the direction and expansion
                                        RAM (same as VDP R#45)
                * LOGOP (F570H, 1)      logical operation code (same as the
                                        logical operation code of VDP)

  Output:       the CY flag is reset

  Registers:    all


2. Transferring data between RAM and VRAM

To use the routines below, the following memory space should be allocated as 
graphic area for screen modes.

* screen mode 6
     number of dots in X direction times number of dots in Y direction/4 + 4

* screen mode 5 or 7
     number of dots in X direction times number of dots in Y direction/2 + 4

* screen mode 8
     number of dots in X direction times number of dots in Y direction/2 + 4


Note to raise fractions.

For disk or RAM, data to indicate the size is added as the array data. The 
first two bytes of data indicate the number of dots in X direction; the next 
two bytes indicate the number of dots in the Y direction.


* BLTVM (0195H/SUB)

  Function:     transfers the array to VRAM

  Input:        HL register <-- F562H
                The following parameters should be set:

                * DPTR (F562H, 2)       source address of memory
                * DUMMY (F564H, 2)      dummy (not required to be set)
                * DX (F566H, 2)         X-coordinate of the destination
                * DY (F568H, 2)         Y-coordinate of the destination
                * NX (F56AH, 2)         number of dots in the X direction
                                        (not required to be set; this is
                                        already in the top of data to be
                                        transferred)
                * NY (F56CH, 2)         number of dots in the Y direction
                                        (not required to be set; this is
                                        already in the top of data to be
                                        transferred)
                * CDUMMY (F56EH, 1)     dummy (not required to be set)
                * ARG (F56FH, 1)        selects the direction and expansion
                                        RAM (same as VDP R#45)
                * LOGOP (F570H, 1)      logical operation code (same as the
                                        logical operation code of VDP)

  Output:       the CY flag is set when the number of data bytes to be
                transferred is incorrect

  Registers:    all


* BLTMV (0199H/SUB)

  Function:     transfers to the array from VRAM

  Input:        HL register <-- F562H
                The following parameters should be set:

                * SX (F562H, 2)         X-coordinate of the source
                * SY (F564H, 2)         Y-coordinate of the source
                * DPTR (F566H, 2)       destination address of memory
                * DUMMY (F568H, 2)      dummy (not required to be set)
                * NX (F56AH, 2)         number of dots in the X direction
                * NY (F56CH, 2)         number of dots in the Y direction
                * CDUMMY (F56EH, 1)     dummy (not required to be set)
                * ARG (F56FH, 1)        selects the direction and expansion
                                        RAM (same as VDP R#45)

  Output:       the CY flag is reset

  Registers:    all


3. Transferring between the disk and RAM or VRAM

The filename should be set first to use the disk (specify the filename as 
BASIC). The following is an example:

                .
                .
                .
        LD      HL,FNAME                ; Get pointer to file name
        LD      (FNPTR),HL              ; Set it to parameter area
                .
                .
                .
FNAME:  DB 22H,"B:TEST.PIC",22H,0       ; "TEST.PIC", end mark

When an error occurs, control jumps to the error handler of the BASIC 
interpreter. Set the hook to handle the error in the user program or to call 
this routine from MSX-DOS or a ROM cartridge. This hook is H.ERRO (FFB1H).


* BLTVD (019DH/SUB)

  Function:     transfers from disk to VRAM

  Input:        HL register <-- F562H
                The following parameters should be set:

                * FNPTR (F562H, 2)      address of the filename
                * DUMMY (F564H, 2)      dummy (not required to be set)
                * DX (F566H, 2)         X-coordinate of the destination
                * DY (F568H, 2)         Y-coordinate of the destination
                * NX (F56AH, 2)         number of dots in the X direction
                                        (not required to be set; this is
                                        already in the top of data to be
